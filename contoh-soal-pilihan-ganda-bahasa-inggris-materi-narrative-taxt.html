                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

Vacation to London

<br />

<br />2 months ago, my family and I got vacation in london. I was with my 
parents to go to London during the school holidays. We looked at travel 
agents and booked tickets. Arriving there, we went to the British 
Embassy to obtain a visa in order to enter the UK. We had booked a 
fourteen day tour. This included accommodation, roads and traveling 
tours around London. We went to London with large Boeing plane. We were 
in the plane about 14 hours for the trip.

<br /><br />On the plane, the flight attendants were very friendly. They gave 
newspapers and magazines so that we could read and not easily bored. 
They also gave us food and drink and not to forget the movie for 
entertainment as well. They provided a very pleasant flight services. We
 were able to fall asleep when we were in the plane.












when we arrived at Heathrow airport, we had to go to the Customs and 
Immigration. The officials are very kind. They checked our documents 
carefully and serve us with a very polite and friendly. my family and I 
should collect our bags and went to London. Our bags were already set to
 be transferred to the hotel.

<br />

Hotel which we live were the famous four-star hotel. We got a perfect 
view of the park. The room had bathroom and toilet too. On the third 
floor, there were a restaurant that has a wide variety of foods. they 
were able to present the Asian and European food.

<br />

<br />Two weeks in London passed quickly. At the end of 14-days, we were pretty tired but we feel very happy.

                        Goose and the Golden Egg<br />Once a farmer went to the nest swan and found there was an egg, yellow and shiny. When he took it, the egg was as heavy as stone. He was almost going to throw it away because he thought that someone was mengerjainya. But once you think about it, he took it home and realized that it was an egg of pure gold!<br />She sells the eggs for money very much. Every morning the goose laying the golden eggs to another, and the farmers became rich by selling eggs.<br />When he became rich, he also grew greedy. "Why do I have to wait to get only one egg a day?" He thought. "I will cut the goose and take all the eggs out of the body at once."<br />When the goose heard the farmer's plan, he immediately flew away to another farm nearby. So, when the farmer came out the next day, you know what he found in the swan's nest? Nothing.<br />Moral: People who always want more frequent sometimes lose everything. If you want something, be patient. If you are greedy, you may lose what you already have.<br /><br />atau<br /><br />A Wolf and Dog<br />Once upon a time there was a wolf who nearly died of starvation. He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />

                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground.

                        <p>                                                A Mouse and A Lion</p><p>Once, as a lion lay
sleeping in his den, a naughty little mouse ran up his tail, onto his back, up
his mane and danced and jumped on his head, so that the lion woke up.<br /><br />
lion angry grabbed the mouse and, holding him in
his large claws, roared in anger. 'How dare you wake me up! Don't you know that
I am King of the Beasts? Anyone who disturbs my rest deserves to die! I shall
kill you and eat you!'<br /><br />
The terrified mouse, shaking and trembling, begged
the lion to let him go. 'Please don't eat me Your Majesty! I did not mean to
wake you, it was a mistake. I was only playing. Please let me go - and I
promise I will be your friend forever. Who knows but one day I could save your
life?'<br /><br />
The lion looked at the tiny mouse and laughed.
'You save my life? What an absurd idea!' he said scornfully. 'But you have made
me laugh, and put me into a good mood again, so I shall let you go.' And the
lion opened his claws and let the mouse go free.<br /><br />
'Oh thank you, your majesty,' squeaked the mouse,
and scurried away as fast as he could.<br /><br />
A few days later the lion was caught in a hunter's
snare. Struggle as he might, he couldn't break free and became even more
entangled in the net of ropes. He let out a roar of anger that shook the
forest. Every animal heard it, including the tiny mouse.<br /><br />
The mouse was rushing to the source of its roar
and he found the lion was powerless. The mouse then bit the rope that cought
the lion so that the lion can escape from the trap. The lions are very grateful
to the mouse, and they became friends best forever.</p><p>                                 Seekor Tikus dan Seekor Singa<br /></p><p>Suatu ketika ada seekor singa yang sedang berbaring
tidur di sarangnya, tikus kecil nakal berlari ke ekornya, ke punggunya, ke
surainya dan menari serta melompat di kepalanya, sehingga singa itu pun
terbangun.<br /><br />
singa marah menerkam tikus tersebut dan memegangnya dalam
kuku-kukunya yang besar, meraung dalam kemarahan. "Berani-beraninya kau
membangunkan saya! Tidak tahukah kamu bahwa saualah Raja semua binatang?
Siapapun yang mengganggu istirahat saya layak mati! Saya akan membunuhmu dan
makanmu!'<br /><br />
Tikus tersebut ketakutan dan gemetaran, memohon agar sang
singa untuk membiarkannya pergi. 'Tolong jangan makan saya Yang Mulia! Saya
tidak bermaksud untuk membangunkan Anda, itu adalah sebuah kesalahan. Saya
hanya bermain. Tolong biarkan saya pergi - dan saya berjanji akan menjadi teman
Anda selamanya. Siapa tahu suatu hari saya bisa menyelamatkan hidup Anda?'<br /><br />
Singa menatap tikus kecil tersebut dan tertawa. "Kau
menyelamatkan hidup saya? Apa ide tidak masuk akal!" katanya mencemooh.
"Tapi kamu telah membuat saya tertawa, dan menempatkan saya ke dalam
suasana hati yang baik lagi, jadi saya akan membiarkan kamu pergi." Dan
singa membuka cakarnya dan membiarkan tikus itu pergi bebas.<br /><br />
"Oh terima kasih, Yang Mulia, 'decit tikus tersebut, dan
bergegas pergi secepat yang dia bisa.<br /><br />
Beberapa hari kemudian singa itu tertangkap dalam jerat
pemburu. Ia berjuang sebisa mungkin, ia tidak mampu melepaskan diri dan bahkan
menjadi lebih terjerat dalam jaring tali terseubt. Dia mengeluarkan raungan
kemarahan yang mengguncang hutan. Setiap hewan mendengarnya, termasuk tikus
kecil tersebut.<br /><br />Tikus itu pun bergegas menuju ke sumber aungan tersebut dan
ia mendapati sang singa sudah tidak berdaya. Tikus tersebut kemudian menggigit
tali yang menjerat singa sampai putus sehingga sang singa bisa lepas dari jerat
perangkap tersebut. Sang singa sangat berterima kasih pada tikus tersebut, dan
merekapun menjadi teman sejati selamanya.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>smoga membantu..tandai sbg jawaban terbaik ya</p><br />

                        CINDERELLA<br /><br /><p>One day, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with a
 wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very
 bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s 
palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her 
stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, 
they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the 
party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she 
did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a
 party and left Cinderella alone at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy 
godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball 
now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a
 dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be 
worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into 
the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy 
godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly 
Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and 
said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother
 then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden
 four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy 
Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, 
because this magic will works only until midnight!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her 
beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so 
different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass 
slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He 
met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I 
want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night 
and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother 
warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last 
moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and 
went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass 
slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the 
clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous 
shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress 
anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked 
about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very 
curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in 
love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even 
did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he 
said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into 
this glass slipper!”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the 
existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the 
size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper 
but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her 
stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let 
her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect 
leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced 
that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married 
Cinderella and they lived happily.</p><br /><br /><br />
