                         The Goose and The Golden Eggs<br /><br />Once a farmer went to the nest of his goose and found there an egg, all yellow and shiny. When he picked it up, it was heavy as a rock. 1 He was about to throw it away because he thought that someone was playing a trick on him. 2 But on second thought, he took it home, and discovered to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold!<br /><br />He sold the egg for a lot of money. Every morning the goose laid another golden egg, and the farmer soon became rich by selling the eggs.<br /><br />As he grew rich, he also grew greedy. 6 “Why should I have to wait to get only one egg a day?” he thought. “I will cut open the goose and take all the eggs out of her at once.”<br /><br />When the goose heard the farmer’s plan, she flew away to a nearby farm. So when the farmer came out the next day, do you know what he found in the goose’s nest? 8 Nothing.<br /><br />Moral: Someone who wants more often loses all. When you want something, be patient. If you are greedy, you might lose what you already have<br /><br />Terjemahan:<br /><br />Angsa dan Telur Emas<br /><br />Suatu ketika seorang petani pergi ke sarang angsa dan menemukan ada sebuah telur, warnanya kuning dan mengkilap. Ketika ia mengambilnya, telur itu berat seperti batu. Dia hampir akan membuangnya karena ia pikir bahwa seseorang sedang mengerjainya. Tapi setelah dipikir-pikir lagi, ia membawanya pulang dan menyadari bahwa itu adalah telur emas murni!<br /><br />Dia menjual telur tersebut untuk uang yang sangat banyak. Setiap pagi angsa tersebut bertelur telur emas yang lain, dan petani tersebut pun menjadi kaya dengan menjual telur-telur tersebut.<br /><br />Ketika ia menjadi kaya, ia juga tumbuh serakah. “Mengapa saya harus menunggu untuk mendapatkan hanya satu telur sehari?” Pikirnya. “Saya akan membelah angsa tersebut dan mengambil semua telur keluar dari tubuhnya sekaligus.”<br /><br />Ketika angsa tersebut mendengar rencana petani itu, ia segera terbang pergi ke sebuah peternakan lain di dekatnya. Jadi, ketika petani tersebut keluar di hari berikutnya, kau tahu apa yang ia temukan di sarang angsa itu? Tidak ada.<br /><br />Moral: Orang yang selalu ingin lebih kadang sering kehilangan semuanya. Jika kamu menginginkan sesuatu, bersabarlah. Jika kamu serakah, kamu mungkin kehilangan apa yang sudah kamu miliki.<br /><br />a cat and a fox story<br /><br />One day a cat and s fox were having a conversation. The fox, who was a conceited creature, boasted how clever she was. “Why, I know at least a hundred tricks to get away from our mutual enemies, the dogs,” she said.<br />“I know only one trick to get away from dogs,” said the cat. “You should teach me some of yours!”<br />“Well, maybe someday, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones.” Replied the fox airily. Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder, the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. “This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,” she called down to the fox. “ Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?”<br />The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived. They fell upon the fox and tore her to pieces.<br />A single plan that works is better than a hundred doubtful plans.<br /><br />

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

lived a young man named Galoran. He was respected because of his wealth and
honor. His parents were nobleman so he could live with luxury. However, he was
very wasteful and every day just squandered the wealth of his parents.

<br /><br />

One day, his parents
died, but he did not care and continued to spend money as well as before.
Because his life was so extravagant, all the treasure that he had was running
out and he became an unemployed person. Many people sympathized with him and
offered a job. But every time he got the job, he just dallied and it made him
always be fired. Several months later, there was a wealthy widow who interested
him. He married the widow and of course, he was very happy to be living in
luxury again.

<br /><br />

The widow had a
daughter who was very diligent and clever to weave. Her name is Jambean, a
beautiful girl and had been famous because of her weaving. However, Galoran did
not like the girl, because the girl often scolded him because of his laziness.
Finally, he threatened to torture and kill Jambean. He revealed the plan to his
wife and the wife was very sad to hear of the threat.

<br /><br />

Hearing the news,
Jambean was very sad but she volunteered herself to be killed by her father.
She told that she wanted to be dumped into a dam and did not burry under the
ground after the death. The mother agreed and did all of her wants. In the dam,
her body and head suddenly turned into the golden slugs.

<br /><br />

Several years later,
there are two widows who were looking for firewood. They were kindred, the
first widow named Mbok Rondo Sambega and the second called Mbok Rondo Sembagil.
When looking for the firewood in the jungle, they were very surprised because
of finding the beautiful golden slugs. They brought it and maintained at home.

<br /><br />

Once they brought the
snails, there was always a miracle every day. Their kitchen was always filled
with the delicious food when they came home from work. They were very surprised,
and wanted to know the person who made those foods. They pretended to go to
work and hid in the back of the house. A few moments later, there was a
beautiful girl came from the inside of the conch and she began to cook the
delicious meals.

Both widows then
secretly held and did not let the girl to get into the snail anymore. The girl
apparently was Jambean who had been killed by her father. Both widows then
allowed her to stay with them. Because of their versatility in weaving, she got
her famous back and made a handsome prince attracted. In the end, she married
the prince and lived happily.

                        One day, Mouse Deer went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.<br />In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.”<br />“Really…? Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as he ran to the forest.***<br />

No one was near, except for three farmers he could sometimes see working in the fi elds in the valley below.</p><p></p><p>One day the boy thought of a plan that would help him get a little company and have some fun. 3 He ran down toward the valley crying, “Wolf!

</p><p>One day, a mouse deer was walking by the river. He was very starving because he hadn't eaten since morning. It was midday. But he found nothing in the land but dying trees. "Huh... I hate this branches, I don't like it!"
</p><p>
</p><p>Across the river, there was green grassland, with young leaves. 'Hmm.. it seems delicious' imagined the mouse deer, 'but how can I get there? I can't swim, the current is very rapid?'
</p><p>
</p><p>The mouse deer was figuring out the way how to reach there. Suddenly, he jumped to the air,'aha.: he then walked to the edge of the river. He didn't see the reflection because the water flowed very fast. He dipped one of his fore legs into the water. A few moment later, appeared Mr. Crocodile showing his sharp teeth. He then laughed, "Ha... ha... ha, you can't run away from me, You'll be my tasty lunch!" said the crocodile.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Of course I can't. You are very strong, Mr. Croco," replied the mouse deer frightenedly. Then, the other crocodiles approached moving slowly.They approached the edge of the river.
</p><p>
</p><p>"But, before you all have a party, I wonder how many your members are there in the river. If I know your number exactly, I can distribute my meat evenly,"said the mouse deer.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Oh...o, great, good idea! But we are a large group, I can't count it precisely," Mr. Croco moaned. "Leave it to me, and I can make it for you!" Now, can you ask the others to line up, from one edge to the other edge of the river? The mouse deer requested. Then the crocodiles arranged themselves in line from one edge to the other edge of the river. The mouse deer jumped to the body of one crocodile to the others while he was counting, 'one, two, three; and so forth up to ten. Then at last he arrived at grassland, and he thanked to the dumb crocodiles.    </p><p>4. Why did mouse deer want to go across the river?

The rabbit arrogantly posed a challenge to all forest dwellers to be able to defeat him.</p><p>When none of the other animals dared to accept his challenge, suddenly the turtle, which was known to walk very slowly, said he had accepted the challenge. One forest in unison laughed at him in disbelief. Moreover, the rabbit who was so arrogant underestimated the ability of the turtle.</p><p>On the day of the start of the match the <strong>rabbit </strong>began to show his ability to run very fast at the beginning of the match.

The Monkeys and The Cap Seller 

<br />
Once,
 a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed
 to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed 
his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head. The
 cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first 
thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all
 his caps were not there.<br /><br /> 
            When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see 
monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is 
wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate himHe
 decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys.
 In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make 
gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br /><br /><br />
At
 last he found a clever idea. " Monkeys are a great imitator," he 
thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And
 as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the 
caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, 
put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />The Generic Structure of above Narrative Story Is :<br /><br />Orientation: The
 cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time 
setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion 
that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and 
where of the story.Complication: The
 cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do 
not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. 
Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That 
is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.Resolution: The
 cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing 
his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is 
solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps 
returned.<br /><br />

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at
once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?"

<br />

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
"Because he is not Phil Collins!"
