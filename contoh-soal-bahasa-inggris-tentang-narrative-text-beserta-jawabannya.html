                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        The Ant And The Grasshopper<br />In a field one summer’s day a grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content. An ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.<br />“Why not come and chat with me,” said the grasshopper, “instead of toiling and moiling in that way?”<br />“I am helping to lay up food for the winter,” said the ant, “and recommend you to do the same.”<br />“Why bother about winter?” said the grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present.” The Ant went on its way and continued its toil.<br />When the winter came the grasshopper found itself dying of hunger while it saw the ants distributing, every day, corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer.<br /><br />Di suatu lapangan, saat musim panas, seekor  belalang melompat girang, berkicau dan bernyanyi sesuka hatinya. Sementara seekeor semut sedang lewat, sambil mambawa bongkahan biji jagung dibawahnya dengan susah payah menuju sarangnya.<br />"Mengapa kamu tidak disini saja sambil ngobrol denganku," kata Belalang, "dari pada lalulalang kerja keras seperti itu??"<br />"Aku bekerja  untuk mengumpulkan makanan sebegai persediaan musim dingin nanti," kata semut itu, "dan memeberikan contoh padamu supaya kamu juga mengumpulkan makanan seperti aku."<br />"Kenapa aku harus repot-repot mengkhawatirkan musim dingin" kata Belalang; "Kami sudah punya banyak makanan saat ini." Meskipun begitu semut itu tetap melanjutkan dan terus kerja keras.<br />Ketika musim dingin datang, belalang itu pun mati kelaparan, sementara si semut mendistribusikan jagung dan gandum setiap hari dari toko mereka yang sudah dikumpulkan saat musim panas yang lalu.<br /><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>"Yummy, this is my lunch," said Baya.
</p><p>
</p><p>"No way! This is my lunch. You are greedy" said Sura. Then they fought for the goat. After several hours, they were very tired.
</p><p>
</p><p>Feeling tired of fighting, they lived in the different places. Sura lived in the water and Baya lived in the land. The border was the beach, so they would never fight again.
</p><p>

</p><p>Dahulu kala, ada dua binatang, Sura dan Baya. Sura adalah nama hiu dan Baya adalah buaya. Mereka hidup di laut.

</p><p>Suatu ketika Sura dan Baya mencari makanan. Tiba-tiba, Baya melihat seekor kambing.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Enak, ini makan siangku," kata Baya.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Tidak mungkin! Ini makan siangku. Kamu rakus," kata Sura. Kemudian mereka memperjuangkan kambing. Setelah beberapa jam, mereka sangat lelah.
</p><p>
</p><p>Merasa lelah berkelahi, mereka tinggal di tempat yang berbeda. Sura tinggal di air dan Baya tinggal di tanah. Perbatasan adalah pantai, jadi mereka tidak akan pernah bertarung lagi.
</p><p>
</p><p>Suatu hari, Sura pergi ke tanah dan mencari makanan di sungai. Dia sangat lapar dan tidak ada banyak makanan di laut. Baya sangat marah ketika dia tahu bahwa Sura mengingkari janji.</p><strong></strong><p>Semoga membantu :)</p><p></p><br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

                        <strong>The three farmer’s son</strong>
Once upon a time, there lived a sick 
poor farmer aid his three sons: Bill, Thomas, and john. Being on the 
point of death, the father bequeathed his things to them. Bill inherited
 his cow, Thomas got his plow, and john received his plant’s seeds. Soon
 afterward, their father died. Bill and Thomas decided to go out from 
their small hut and lived their life alone. When their little brother 
asked them to lend him their plow and cow, they refused to help and 
mocked him. Then they sold their cow and plow and spent the money 
without thinking of the future. John then couldn’t help but worked hard 
by himself to grow the seeds without any help from his brothers.
Years passed, john had gathered the 
sweet fruits of his sweats and hard works in the past and thus became a 
rich farmer. One day when he was buying some fruits in the market, 
somebody stole his wallet. As he ran to get his wallet back, the thief 
hit a beggar and fell down. John then realized that the thief and the 
beggar were his own brothers. Bill and Thomas then begged for their 
little brother forgiveness of being so arrogant and selfish. After 
listening to his brothers’ stories, john invited his brothers to live 
together with him. The three then worked together and became great and 
rich farmers.<br /><br /><strong>Tiga Anak Petani</strong>
Dahulu kala, hiduplah seorang petani 
miskin yang sakit dan dibantu oleh ketiga anaknya: Bill, Thomas, dan 
John. Berada di ambang kematian, sang ayah mewariskan beberapa hal 
kepada mereka. Bill mewarisi sapinya, Thomas mendapat alat bajak, dan 
John menerima bibit tanaman nya. Segera setelah itu, ayah mereka 
meninggal. Bill dan Thomas memutuskan untuk pergi keluar dari gubuk 
kecil mereka dan menjalani hidup mereka sendiri. Ketika adik mereka 
meminta mereka untuk meminjamkan bajak dan sapi, mereka menolak untuk 
membantu dan mengolok-oloknya. Kemudian mereka menjual sapi dan bajak 
mereka dan menghabiskan uang tanpa memikirkan masa depan. John kemudian 
tidak bisa membantu tetapi bekerja keras sendiri untuk menumbuhkan benih
 tanpa bantuan dari saudara-saudaranya.
Tahun-tahun berlalu, john telah 
mengumpulkan buah manis dari keringat dan kerja keras di masa lalu dan 
dengan demikian ia menjadi seorang petani kaya. Suatu hari ketika ia

lived a young man named Galoran. He was respected because of his wealth and
honor. His parents were nobleman so he could live with luxury. However, he was
very wasteful and every day just squandered the wealth of his parents.

<br /><br />

One day, his parents
died, but he did not care and continued to spend money as well as before.
Because his life was so extravagant, all the treasure that he had was running
out and he became an unemployed person. Many people sympathized with him and
offered a job. But every time he got the job, he just dallied and it made him
always be fired. Several months later, there was a wealthy widow who interested
him. He married the widow and of course, he was very happy to be living in
luxury again.

<br /><br />

The widow had a
daughter who was very diligent and clever to weave. Her name is Jambean, a
beautiful girl and had been famous because of her weaving. However, Galoran did
not like the girl, because the girl often scolded him because of his laziness.
Finally, he threatened to torture and kill Jambean. He revealed the plan to his
wife and the wife was very sad to hear of the threat.

<br /><br />

Hearing the news,
Jambean was very sad but she volunteered herself to be killed by her father.
She told that she wanted to be dumped into a dam and did not burry under the
ground after the death. The mother agreed and did all of her wants. In the dam,
her body and head suddenly turned into the golden slugs.

<br /><br />

Several years later,
there are two widows who were looking for firewood. They were kindred, the
first widow named Mbok Rondo Sambega and the second called Mbok Rondo Sembagil.
When looking for the firewood in the jungle, they were very surprised because
of finding the beautiful golden slugs. They brought it and maintained at home.

<br /><br />

Once they brought the
snails, there was always a miracle every day. Their kitchen was always filled
with the delicious food when they came home from work. They were very surprised,
and wanted to know the person who made those foods. They pretended to go to
work and hid in the back of the house. A few moments later, there was a
beautiful girl came from the inside of the conch and she began to cook the
delicious meals.

Both widows then
secretly held and did not let the girl to get into the snail anymore. The girl
apparently was Jambean who had been killed by her father. Both widows then
allowed her to stay with them. Because of their versatility in weaving, she got
her famous back and made a handsome prince attracted. In the end, she married
the prince and lived happily.

The Monkeys and The Cap Seller 

<br />
Once,
 a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed
 to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed 
his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head. The
 cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first 
thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all
 his caps were not there.<br /><br /> 
            When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see 
monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is 
wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate himHe
 decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys.
 In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make 
gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br /><br /><br />
At
 last he found a clever idea. " Monkeys are a great imitator," he 
thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And
 as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the 
caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, 
put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />The Generic Structure of above Narrative Story Is :<br /><br />Orientation: The
 cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time 
setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion 
that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and 
where of the story.Complication: The
 cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do 
not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. 
Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That 
is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.Resolution: The
 cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing 
his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is 
solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps 
returned.<br /><br />

                        “story of romance” is the guiding text offered by contemporary American culture, and more generally the culture of the modern West, on the subject of how women and men (should) relate: find your One True Love—your one-and-only—and live happily ever after.[1] To the ancient and perennial question of how to define and live the good life, how to achieve happiness and fulfillment, American pop culture’s resounding answer is through the narrative of romance, sex, and love. The happily-in-love, pair-bonded (generally, although increasingly not exclusively, heterosexual) couple is made into a near-mandatory norm by the media and popular culture, as this romance story is endlessly taught and replayed in a multiplicity of cultural sites: Disney princess movies consumed by three-year-olds, the wedding industry, Hollywood, pop music lyrics, advertising, popular magazines, the diamond jewelry industry, and more. One of the most important of these sites, where romance is taught, re-told, and—a crucial point—experimented with in new forms, is in the literal “romance story” of mass market genre fiction.While there are clearly significant differences—among these media forms and certainly among the diversity of the immense romance readership, as well as in the variety of subgenres and plots within the romance publishing field—nonetheless there are significant similarities across these categories as well. The basic plotline of the romance narrative holds true despite subgenre variation, which, as we’ll see in the case of erotica and paranormal, can serve simply to highlight the core genre message. As such, likening readers and novels and considering the phenomenon of romance narrative as a whole allows important insights to emerge. More specifically, in this article, I argue romance novels are so popular partly because they do deep and complicated work for the (mostly) women who read them—work that derives from the mythic or religious nature of the romance narrative that serves to engage readers in a “reparation fantasy” of healing in regards to male-female relations. Romance novels help women readers, especially heterosexual women, deal with their essentially paradoxical relationship toward men within a culture still marked by patriarchy and its component threat of violence toward women.[2]Most baldly put, this paradox has women in a position of simultaneously desiring and fearing men. Romance novels function as an antidote, as a way of pleasurably working through—in fantasy, in the safe and imaginative play world of fiction—the contradictory position of the heterosexual woman within patriarchal rape culture. This complex work, we will see, involves reconciling women to the limits and threats specifically posed to them as women by the culture, yet also teaching women to refuse to accept such limits and threats as normative and empowering them to expect or demand better for themselves. Furthermore, I argue that the industry subcategories of erotica (including gay/lesbian and “slash” romance) and paranormal—both areas of strong recent growth within the overall genre—offer new and highly effective literary means for women to use romance fiction as a way of working out their position within the culture. Indeed, the mainstream growth of erotica in particular signals important changes in American cultural attitudes towards women’s sexuality and perhaps, finally, a loosening of the patriarchal knot of allowable sexual expression.This article forms the initial part of an ongoing monograph project on the romance narrative in popular culture, focusing especially on popular romance fiction. I seek to understand how this romance narrative functions and how it is currently changing, both as a genre of popular literature and as a form of human relationship. Unlike some lines of previous academic inquiry into romance fiction, my goal has little to do with either critique or defense of the genre, nor do I aim for close literary reading of individual authors (e.g., Radway 1991, Coddington 1997, Regis 2003, Goade 2007). Like Tania Modleski, I seek to read “symptomatically” (2008, xix), not intending by this metaphor for romance fiction to be taken as illness or pathology, but simply as a rich cultural site that yields much insight into critical issues of gender and sexuality in America today. I seek to place romance fiction in the broader context of the romance narrative in popular culture; and to adopt a framework of cultural studies, religious studies, gender studies, and sex-positive feminist theory to ask questions about meaning, fantasy, fear, and desire in how the romance narrative plays out in the realms of both popular and high culture in which this story holds such vast sway.<br /><br />

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

                        Goose and the Golden Egg<br />Once a farmer went to the nest swan and found there was an egg, yellow and shiny. When he took it, the egg was as heavy as stone. He was almost going to throw it away because he thought that someone was mengerjainya. But once you think about it, he took it home and realized that it was an egg of pure gold!<br />She sells the eggs for money very much. Every morning the goose laying the golden eggs to another, and the farmers became rich by selling eggs.<br />When he became rich, he also grew greedy. "Why do I have to wait to get only one egg a day?" He thought. "I will cut the goose and take all the eggs out of the body at once."<br />When the goose heard the farmer's plan, he immediately flew away to another farm nearby. So, when the farmer came out the next day, you know what he found in the swan's nest? Nothing.<br />Moral: People who always want more frequent sometimes lose everything. If you want something, be patient. If you are greedy, you may lose what you already have.<br /><br />atau<br /><br />A Wolf and Dog<br />Once upon a time there was a wolf who nearly died of starvation. He is very thin, so that the line can be seen clearly bones under his thinning hair. With barely enough energy to run, wolves have little hope of finding food. As he lay down under a large tree, a dog was out for a walk to see him. Look how skinny and hungry wolves, the dog felt sorry for him and said, "You are very terrible condition! You looked as if had not eaten for days."<br />"You're right," said the wolf. "I do not eat because you and your friends do a good job of keeping the sheep. Now I'm so weak that I had little hope of finding food. I thought I would die."<br />Then why not join us? asked the dog. "I work out regularly and I eat regularly. You can also do the same. I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog. "This is the place where former rope on my neck when I bind my lord at night."<br />"Diikiat!" cried wolf, "you mean that you are chained at night? If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />
