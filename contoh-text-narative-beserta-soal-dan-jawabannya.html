                        Flock of Doves<br />
Once upon a time, there was a flock of doves that flew in search of food
 led by their king. They had flown a long distance and were very tired. 
The smallest dove picked up speed and found some rice scattered beneath a
 banyan tree. So all the doves landed and began to eat.<br />
Suddenly a net fell over them and they were all trapped. They saw a 
hunter approaching carrying. The doves desperately fluttered their wings
 trying to get out, but to no avail. The king had an idea. He advised 
all the doves to fly up together carrying the net with them.<br />
Each dove picked up a portion of the net and together they flew off 
carrying the net with them. The hunter looked up in astonishment. He 
tried to follow them, but they were flying high over hills and valleys. 
They flew to a hill near a city of temples where there lived a mouse who
 could help them. He was a faithful friend of the dove king.<br />
The mouse agreed saying that he would set the king free first. The king 
insisted that he first free his subjects and the king last. The mouse 
understood the king’s feelings and complied with his wishes. He began to
 cut the net and one by one all the doves were freed including the dove 
king.<br />

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures.

Unfortunately, the boy said he was not a child anymore. He didn't want 
to play with  the tree. But he asked another request to  the apple tree.

<br />

The tree asked what the boy wanted. The boy said he needed toys, but his parents didn't have money to buy it for him.

<br />

The tree said, "Dear my boy, i don't have any money to buy it for you, 
but you can pick my apples, then sell them, get money and buy  the toys 
you want."

<br />

The boy went happily to his home after plucking apples. The tree was 
waiting to see the boy return. But he never came back for many years.

The Legend of Rawa Pening

Once upon a time, there was a little poor boy came into a little village. He was very hungry and weak. He knocked at every door and asked for some food, but nobody cared about him. Nobody wanted to help the little boy.

Finally, a generous woman helped him. She gave him shelter and a meal. When the boy wanted to leave, this old woman gave him a “lesung”, a big wooden mortar for pounding rice. She reminded him, “please remember, if there is a flood you must save yourself. Use this “lesung” as a boat”. The “lesung” was happy and thanked the old woman.The little boy continued his journey. While he was passing through the village, he saw many people gathering on the field. The boy came closer and saw a stick stuck in the ground. People challenged each other to pull out that stick. Everybody tried, but nobody succeeded. “Can I try?” asked the little boy. The crowd laughed mockingly. The boy wanted to try his luck so he stepped forward and pulled out the stick. He could do it very easily. Everybody was dumbfounded.

Suddenly, from the hole left by stick, water spouted out. It did not stop until it flooded the village. And no one was saved from the water except the little boy and the generous old woman who gave him shelter and meal. As she told him, he used the “lesung” as a boat and picked up the old woman. The whole village became a huge lake. It is now known as Rawa Pening Lake in Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf<br /><br />There was once a young shepherd boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. 1 It was lonely for him watching the sheep all day. No one was near, except for three farmers he could sometimes see working in the fi elds in the valley below.<br /><br />One day the boy thought of a plan that would help him get a little company and have some fun. 3 He ran down toward the valley crying, “Wolf! Wolf!”<br /><br />The men ran to meet him, and after they found out there was no wolf after all, one man remained to talk with the boy awhile.<br /><br />The boy enjoyed the company so much that a few days later he tried the same prank again, and again the men ran to help him.<br /><br />A few days later, a real wolf came from the forest and began to steal the sheep. The startled 6 boy ran toward the valley, and more loudly than ever he cried, “Wolf! Wolf!”<br /><br />But the men, who had been fooled twice before, thought that the boy was tricking them again. So no one came to help the boy save his sheep.<br /><br />Moral: If you often don’t tell the truth, people won’t believe you even when you are telling the truth.<br /><br /><br />

                        Two Best Friends<p>             Once upon a time, in a village near the jungle, there were two poor best friends named Cleo and Patra. Every day, they went to the jungle to find fire wood to be sold. Cleo was  strong while Patra was quick and agile. Cleo could fell down a tree with one punch while Patra was able to cut the tree to small piece in very short time. They always helped each other and they get along together, and they were afraid of nothing.</p><p>One day they found a treasure map in the jungle. They were so surprised and Cleo invited Patra to find out the treasure.</p><p>“Patra look I got something such a treasure map” Cleo whispered.</p><p>“It just only a fake map, buddy. Don’t trust it” Patra Answered.</p><p>“You always think too short”. Cleo replied. “How about if we try to find it out tomorrow”? He invited.</p><p>“Hmmmm” Patra was thinking.</p><p>“If we are lucky we will be the richest men in this village. Like what we always dream” Patra said.</p><p>Okay. Patra replied.</p><p>. The next day Cleo and Patra went to find the treasure based on the map they had gotten. The map guided them to a cave. Then they went inside. After they had walked for hundred meters, they met two branches of tunnels -yellow and blue tunnel- in the cave. As their problem, there was not a direction about what the right tunnel in the map, so that they were confused to think which tunnel they should choose.</p><p>As a result, they began to debate. Cleo thought that blue tunnel was the right way, whereas Patra preferred to choose Yellow cave. Then they were insulting each other.</p><p>“Blue tunnel is the right way” Cleo said.</p><p>“But I have good felling with this yellow tunnel” Patra replied.</p><p>Then Cleo said “Your felling is hoax, just listen to me. I always better making decision than you”.</p><p> Patra was very angry hearing Cleo’s last statement and they fought. Finally they separated by choosing different tunnel to get the treasure. After that, each of them met big and spooky creatures who guarded the treasure.

                        Once, a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head.<br />The cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all his caps were not there.<br />When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate him<br />He decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys. In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br />At last he found a clever idea. ” Monkeys are a great imitator,” he thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />Note on Generic Structure: The generic structure of above narrative story is:<br />Orientation: The cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and where of the story.<br />Complication: The cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.<br />Resolution: The cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps returned.<br />

Bromo<br />
Hundreds years ago, the last king of Majapahit had a young princess from one of
his wives. The princess was named Roro Anteng. Later, Roro Anteng married Joko
Seger, who came from Brahman caste. </p>

<p>Because of unfortunate situation the couple was forced to leave the
kingdom. They settled in the mountain area. They ruled the area and named it
Tengger, which was derived from their names, Roro Anteng and Joko Seger.</p>

<p>After several years of reign, the region flourished in prosperity, but
Roro Anteng and Joko Seger were sad because they did not have a child. They
climbed the top of mountain and prayed there night and day hoping that the God
would listen. The prayer was heard and Betoro Bromo promised to give them many
children. However, they had to promise that they would sacrifice their youngest
child in return.</p>

<p>Roro Anteng  gave birth to a child, then another and another. In the
end, Roro Anteng and Joko Seger had 25 children. Soon it was time to sacrifice
the youngest child , Kusuma, but the parents could not do it. They tried to
hide him, but an eruption happened and Kusuma fell into the crater. There was
silence before they heard a voice. “I have to be sacrificed so that you will
all stay alive. From now on, you should arrange an annual offering ceremony on
the 14th of Kesodo (the twelfth month of Tengerese calendar)”. It was Kusuma’s
voice. Kusuma’s brothers and sisters held the offering ceremony every year.
Instead of human being, they collected fruits, vegetables, rice, and meat to be
off to the Gods. And this has been done generation after generation until
today.</p>

                        The Ant and the Dove<br /><br />One hot day, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water. She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked off a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.Not long after at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his net towards the dove, hoping to trap it. Guessing what he was about to do, the antquickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to safety.<br /><br />The morality: One good turn deserves another.<br />

                        legend sangkuriang<br />A long time ago, the ancient land of Sunda was ruled by a king and a queen who had but a single daughter. Her name was Dayang Sumbi. She was beautiful and clever but also pampered and spoiled. One day as she was weaving in her pavilion, she became moody and distracted, which caused her to keep dropping her shuttle on the floor. Once when it fell she exclaimed she would marry the one who gave it back to her. At that very moment her dog Tumang, a demigod possessing magic powers, came up to her with the shuttle in his mouth. Dayang Sumbi had to marry him.<br />They lived happily together, and Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy, human in appearance but endowed with his father’s magic powers. She named him Sangkuriang. As the boy grew up, he was always guarded by the faithful dog Tumang, whom he knew only as a companion and not as his father, Sangkuriang became handsome and brave.One day his mother asked him to go hunting with the dog and bring her venison for a feast. After hunting all day withoutsuccess, Sangkuriang worried about facing his mother empty-handed. Desperate, he took an arrow and shot the dog. He returned home and handed over the meat to his pleased mother.<br />Soon after the feast, however, Dayang Sumbi questioned her son about the absence of Tumang. At first he evaded herqueries but finally told her what had happened. She was horrified and struck her son so hard on the temple that he<br />collapsed. For that, the old kinbanished his daughter from the court and she was made to roam around the kingdom. Sangkuriang recovered with a large scar on his temple, and he too left the court to wander about the world.<br />Years later, Sangkuriang met a beautiful woman and instantly fell in love with her. It was his own mother-they did not recognize each other. He pro¬posed to her and she agreed to marry him. On the day before the wedding, as she was caressing her fiancee’s hair, Dayang Sumbi detected the scar on the temple. Horror struck her, for she was about to marry her own son, Sang¬kuriang. Without revealing the whole truth to him, she tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him.When Dayang Sumbi saw that he was about to accomplish what she had thought impossi¬ble, she called on the gods to bring the sun up early and thwart Sangkuriang.<br />The cock crowed, the sun rose much earlier than usual, and Sangkuriang realized he had been deceived. In a fit of furyhe cursed Dayang Sumbi and kicked the half-finished boat back into the forest. There it lies upside down today, forming the mountain Tangkuban Perahu (Upturned Boat). Not far away is the stump of the tree Sangkuriang had felled, now called Bukit Tunggul. The dam Sangkuriang had built caused the valley to become a lake, where both Sangkuriang andDayang Sumbi drowned themselves. They were never heard of again.<br /><br /><br />

In a field one summer’s day a grasshopper was hopping about, chirping 
and singing to its heart’s content. An ant passed by, bearing along with
 great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.<br />
“Why not come and chat with me,” said the grasshopper, “instead of toiling and moiling in that way?”<br />
“I am helping to lay up food for the winter,” said the ant, “and recommend you to do the same.”<br />
“Why bother about winter?” said the grasshopper; we have got plenty of 
food at present.” The Ant went on its way and continued its toil.<br />
When the winter came the grasshopper found itself dying of hunger while 
it saw the ants distributing, every day, corn and grain from the stores 
they had collected in the summer.<br /><br /></p>

                        There was once an arrogant hare who wanted to prove that he was better than everybody else, so he chose the slowest animal in the county, the tortoise, and invited him to a five mile race.The tortoise accepted his challenge and trained hard for the event, while the hare walked around boasting that he was going to humiliate the tortoise and make him look stupid.The day of the race dawned. The tortoise set off at a slow and steady pace, while the hare was dancing around laughing at him; other animals were laughing too, including the rabbit, the badger, and even the little hedgehog.The hare became exhausted from all his dancing around, so he decided to have a nap. When he awoke, he realised that a few hours had passed and the tortoise was nowhere to be seen. The hare panicked and ran the whole course as fast as he could, which was very fast indeed.As he reached the top of the final hill, he could see the finish line in the distance, with the tortoise walking slowly across it, the victor.<br />Narrative text: Generic StructureAs we all know that a narrative should explore problems among the charracters which lead into an interesting plot of the story. This plot determine the narrative story whether it runs smoothly or not. Well, the following note is the generic structure from the story of Hare and Tortoise.Orientation: It clearly states that the participants are the hare and the tortoise who live in once time.Complication: From the second, third, and forth parragraphs, we see that the major complication is set by the arogant hare. In the firs scene, hare and his suppoeters tried to humiliate tortoise while in the same time the tortoise was practicing hard. Because hare thought it was safe, he took a nap, but that was his big mistake.Resolution: The story of hare and tortoise is closed with the scene of tortoise winning the race. It was a bed and sad ending for hare but it was the victory of tortoise.<br />

                        The Origin of The City Surabaya<br /><br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two animals, Sura and Baya. Sura was the name of a shark and Baya was a crocodile. They dwelled in an ocean.<br /><br />Once Sura and Baya were looking for some nourishment. Abruptly, Baya saw a goat.<br /><br />“Yummy, this is my lunch,” said Baya.<br /><br />“No way! This is my midday meal. You are greedy” said Sura. Then they battled for the goat. After several hours, they were very exhausted.<br /><br />Feeling exhausted of battling, they lived in the different places. Sura dwelled in the water and Baya dwelled in the land. The border was the sandy shore, so they would never battle afresh.<br /><br />One day, Sura went to the land and looked for some nourishment in the stream. He was very famished and there was not much nourishment in the sea. Baya was very furious when he knew that Sura broke the pledge.<br /><br />They fought afresh. They both hit each other. Sura bit Baya's tail. Baya did the same thing to Sura. He bit very hard until Sura eventually provided up and A went back to the sea. Baya was happy.<br />

                        Narrative Text : Red Riding Hood<br /><br />Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little riding hood of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called 'Little Red Riding Hood.'<br /><br />     One day her mother said to her: 'Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, "Good morning", and don't peep into every corner before you do it.'<br /><br />     'I will take great care,' said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.<br /><br />     The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.<br /><br />     'Good day, Little Red Riding Hood,' said he.<br /><br />     'Thank you kindly, wolf.'<br /><br />     'Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?'<br /><br />     'To my grandmother's.'<br /><br />     'What have you got in your apron?'<br /><br />     'Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.'<br /><br />     'Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?'<br /><br />     'A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,' replied Little Red Riding Hood.<br />
