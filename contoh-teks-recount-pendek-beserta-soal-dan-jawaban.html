lived a young man named Galoran. He was respected because of his wealth and
honor. His parents were nobleman so he could live with luxury. However, he was
very wasteful and every day just squandered the wealth of his parents.

<br /><br />

One day, his parents
died, but he did not care and continued to spend money as well as before.
Because his life was so extravagant, all the treasure that he had was running
out and he became an unemployed person. Many people sympathized with him and
offered a job. But every time he got the job, he just dallied and it made him
always be fired. Several months later, there was a wealthy widow who interested
him. He married the widow and of course, he was very happy to be living in
luxury again.

<br /><br />

The widow had a
daughter who was very diligent and clever to weave. Her name is Jambean, a
beautiful girl and had been famous because of her weaving. However, Galoran did
not like the girl, because the girl often scolded him because of his laziness.
Finally, he threatened to torture and kill Jambean. He revealed the plan to his
wife and the wife was very sad to hear of the threat.

<br /><br />

Hearing the news,
Jambean was very sad but she volunteered herself to be killed by her father.
She told that she wanted to be dumped into a dam and did not burry under the
ground after the death. The mother agreed and did all of her wants. In the dam,
her body and head suddenly turned into the golden slugs.

<br /><br />

Several years later,
there are two widows who were looking for firewood. They were kindred, the
first widow named Mbok Rondo Sambega and the second called Mbok Rondo Sembagil.
When looking for the firewood in the jungle, they were very surprised because
of finding the beautiful golden slugs. They brought it and maintained at home.

<br /><br />

Once they brought the
snails, there was always a miracle every day. Their kitchen was always filled
with the delicious food when they came home from work. They were very surprised,
and wanted to know the person who made those foods. They pretended to go to
work and hid in the back of the house. A few moments later, there was a
beautiful girl came from the inside of the conch and she began to cook the
delicious meals.

Both widows then
secretly held and did not let the girl to get into the snail anymore. The girl
apparently was Jambean who had been killed by her father. Both widows then
allowed her to stay with them. Because of their versatility in weaving, she got
her famous back and made a handsome prince attracted. In the end, she married
the prince and lived happily.

It<br />showed how people can quickly change when they<br />have to look after themselves in the jungle. It<br />was an interesting film about a plane which<br />crashed on a small empty island in the Pacific<br />Ocean.<br />Although the passengers were safe, nobody knew<br />where the plane had crashed. So the passengers<br />had to learn how to hunt for food in the jungle<br />and how to catch fish from the sea to eat.<br />After a few weeks, the passengers were eating<br />raw fish and meat.<br />After they had been on the island for two<br />months, three of the men made a boat and sailed<br />away to find help. But their boat sank and they<br />were drowned.<br />The film ended without saying whether the<br />passengers were rescued or not. But my sister<br />and I enjoyed the film.<br />

So, sometimes I argued with my father about that. He said I have to save my money than bringing my motorcycle to the washing service. After my mother arrived from the market, I helped her to bring the stuffs. Then, we prepared the lunch. My mother wanted to cook soup for lunch. I was asked by my mother to sew the vegetables, while my mother peeled the onion. When we were busy at kitchen, my father was watching the television in living room and I didn’t like that part.</p><p>I remembered that I had a plan to see to the cinema with my friend, Lisa. I tried to phone her by my phone but the battery was low so I had to recharge the battery. When I had called her, I was disappointed that she couldn’t go because she had to visit her grandmother. So I stayed at home all day long. To kill my boring time, I played the game on my laptop and surfed on the internet. I downloaded music and movie. I did that because I liked to listen to the music and watched the movie. Then I had lunch with my parents. After that, I took a nap until afternoon. On the night, I did my homework for tomorrow, after that I had a dinner with my parents. I went to the bed at 21.00 because I couldn’t stay up the night.</p><br />

was very beautiful there. We felt the wind blew across to us. We also

Second, we visited Gembira Loka Zoo. We saw many kinds of animals there 
such as monkeys, tigers, crocodiles, snakes, etc. We looked around in 
that Zoo, and also took pictures of those animals. Then, we felt hungry,
 so we went to a restaurant. As soon as we finished our lunc, we decided
 to go home.<br /><br />
For me, that was a beautiful day though I could not visit Malioboro. we really enjoyed it, and I hope I could visit Jogja again.<br /><p>An Unlucky Camping<br /><br />

near a small river. as soon as this was done, we cooked a meal over the open
fire. everything was alright in the afternoon. but at night while we were
singing songs by the campfire, a strong wind blew. it bought disorder to our
tent. we couldn't sleep because it was thundering and raining heavily. lighting

                        <strong>My Vacation in Bali<br /></strong><br />When I was 3nd grade of junior high school, my friends and I trip to 
Bali for vacation. We were there for five days. We got many precious 
experiences during the vacation.<br />First day, we visited Kuta Beach in the morning. We saw the lovely 
sunrise there. It was an outstanding view. Then, we checked in to the 
hotel at the night. After taking a nap at the hotel, we went to Tanah 
Lot. Tanah lot was nice place. It was lovely place for taking photo. We 
saw so many tourists there.<br />Second day, we spent our time on Tanjung Benoa beach. We played water
 sports at there. We drove banana boat and speed boat. In the afternoon,
 We went to Penyu island to see unique animals such as big turtles, 
snake, and sea birds. We felt enjoyed and happy.<br />
The last day, we went to Sangeh. We could enjoy the shady forest. There 
were so many monkeys. Sometimes the monkey could be naughty. We could be
 really close with them. After that, we visited to Sukowati Market. I 
bought Bali T-Shirt, souvenirs and some food for gift there
At the night, we had to check out from the our hotel. We went back home and bring so many unforgettable memories of Bali.<br /><br /><strong>Liburan Ke Bali</strong>
 
Ketika saya masih  duduk di kelas 3 SMP, saya dan teman-teman saya 
pergi ke Bali. Kami berada di sana selama lima hari. Aku mendapatkan 
 banyak pengalaman yang  mengesankan selama liburan.
 
Hari pertama, kami mengunjungi Pantai Kuta di pagi hari. Kami melihat
 indahnya matahari terbit bersama-sama. Itu adalah pemandangan yang luar
 biasa indah. Kemudian, kami check in ke hotel pada malam harinya. 
Setelah menginap semalam, Kami pergi mengunjungi ke Tanah Lot. Tanah Lot
 adalah tempat yang indah. Sangat cocok untuk berfoto. Kami bertemu 
begitu banyak turis lain di sana.
 
Hari kedua, kami mengunjungi di pantai Tanjung Benoa. Kami bermain 
olahraga air seperti banana boat dan speedboat. Pada sore harinya, kami 
juga pergi ke pulau Penyu untuk melihat banyak hewan yang unik seperti 
kura-kura, ular, dan burung laut. Kami sangat senang dan menikmatinya..
 
Hari terakhir, kami menghabiskan waktu kita di Sangeh. Kita bisa 
menikmati hutan hijau dan teduh. Ada begitu banyak monyet. Mereka jinak 
tapi kadang-kadang mereka bias menjadi  nakal. Kita bias begitu dekat 
dengan mereka. Setelah itu, kami pergi ke pasar Sukowati untuk 
berbelanja. Saya membeli beberapa Bali T-Shirt,souvenir dan makanan khas
 Bali.<br /><br />Di malam hari, kami harus check out dari hotel. Kami akan pulang dan 
membawa begitu banyak kenangan yang tidak akan terlupakan dari Bali.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        Holiday in Sari Ringgung Beach<br /><br />Last holiday, I went to Sari Ringgung beach in Pesawaran, Lampung. I went there with my family. We left for the beach from my grandparents home in Tanggamus  at 08.00 a.m. We went there by car. We arrived in the beach at 10:00 a.m.<br /><br />In Sari Ringgung beach, I swam with my brothers and my sisters. After swimming, we play sand together. We made a fort, houses, and hills of sand. After being satisfied playing on the beach, we then took a bath and ate the roasted corn while drinking coconut water. After being fresh anymore, we continued to view seascape on boats.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the atmosphere in the beach. After having fun for about five hours, finally we returned home. Before reaching home, we rested beforehand and ate meatball on the side of the road. The meatball is so tasty that I ate two bowls of meatballs there. Not long after that, we continued the journey and got home safely at 7 p.m.<br /><br />It was a tiring day, but we were very happy, because we got a lot of fun together there.<br /><br />Liburan di Pantai Sari Ringgung<br /><br />Liburan yang lalu, saya pergi ke pantai Sari Ringgung di Pesawaran, Lampung. Saya pergi ke sana dengan keluarga saya. Kami berangkat ke pantai dari rumah kakek saya di Tanggamus pukul 8:00. Kami pergi ke sana naik mobil. Kami tiba di pantai pukul 10:00.<br /><br />Di pantai Sari Ringgung, saya berenang dengan saudara-saudara saya. Setelah berenang, kami bermain pasir bersama-sama. Kami membuat sebuah benteng, rumah, dan bukit-bukit pasir. Setelah puas bermain di pantai, kami kemudian mandi dan makan jagung bakar sambil minum air kelapa muda. Setelah segar kembali, kami lalu melihat pemandangan laut dari atas kapal.<br /><br />Saya benar-benar menikmati suasana di pantai. Setelah bersenang-senang selama sekitar lima jam, akhirnya kami kembali ke rumah. Sebelum sampai rumah, kami beristirahat terlebih dahulu dan makan bakso di pinggir jalan. Bakso itu begitu lezat sehingga aku makan dua mangkuk bakso di sana. Tidak lama setelah itu, kami melanjutkan perjalanan dan sampai di rumah dengan selamat pukul 07:00 malam.<br /><br />        Vacation to London<br />   Mr. Richard's family was on vacation.They are Mr.and Mrs.Richard with two sons.They went to London.They saw their travel agent and booked their tickets.They went to the British Embassy to getvisas to enter Britain  <br />

On Wednesday, my students and I went to Yogyakarta.  We
stayed at Dirgahayu Hotel which is not far from Malioboro. 

            On Thursday, we visited the temple
in Prambanan. There are three big temples, the Brahmana, Syiwa, and Wisnu
temples. They are really amazing. We visited only Brahma and Syiwa temples,
because Wisnu temples is being renovated.

            On Friday morning, we went to Yogya
Kraton. We spent about two hours there. We were lucky because we were led by a
smart and friendly guide. Then we continued our journey to Borobudur.
We arrived there at four p.m.  At 5
p.m.  we heard an announcement that Borobudur gate would be closed.

            In the evening we left for Jakarta by Wisata bus.

I really enjoyed my holiday
in Australia. Last Sunday I visited a marine park called Sea World which is at
surfers’ Paradise near Brisbane. It’s Australia’s largest marine park and I had
a wonderful day there.

The first thing I saw was
the Oceanorium where you can watch all sorts of sea fish and animal under
water. There were huge turtles, sharks, and a beautiful tropical sea fish. The
most exciting thing was watching a man feeding the sharks. He wore a special
diving suit. Then I watched the performance of sea animals. The saw was in a
big outdoor swimming pool. There were killer whales, dolphins and sea lions,
and they did all sort of fantastic things in the water. One of the girls in the
show rode around the pool on the back of killing whale, and another girl rode
underwater on the back of a big turtle. After the saw I had lunch. There were
several big restaurant at the park and I had lunch in a restaurant that was
shape like a ship! Then I watched a wonderful water-ski show which was held on
a lake.

There were lots of other
things to do at the park. There was lake cruising, a train ride, a big water
slide, swimming pools, and an incredible roller coaster called the ‘corkscrew’-
because it goes three loops upside down. But I wish I had gone on the roller
coaster ride before lunch rather than after it!

All ran smoothly at first, but when I'm going back to my house and I had to pass through a narrow slippery roads, I was nervous. I lost my control and I fell into a ditch.<br />Afterwards, I told my parents about the accident. I imagine my mom would be angry and never let me go up again. But the reality is exactly the opposite, my mom was very proud of me. He just gave me some advice and since the accident, I got permission to ride my own bike.<br />

                        43My Holiday

       Last week I went to Mount Bromo. I stayed at my friend's house in
 Probolinggo, East Java. The house has a big garden with colorful 
flowers and a small pool.<br />       In the morning, my friend and I saw 
Mount Batok. The scenery was very beautiful. We rode on horseback. It 
was scary, but it was fun. Then, we went to get a closer look at the 
mountain. We took pictures of the beautiful scanery there. After that, 
we took a rest and had lunch under a big tree. Before we got home, we 
went to the zoo at Wonokromo. We went home in the afternoon.<br />       
We were very tired. However, I think it was really fun to have a holiday
 like this. I hope my next holiday will be more intersting.<br /><br />question :<br />how about mount batok ?<br />= the scenery was very beautiful<br /><br />Last holiday, my family went to Seoul, South Korea. We stayed at Seoul International Hotel. We stayed there for 5 days. First day, we went to Lotte World. It was amazing. The second day, we went to Jeju Island. We stayed there just for 1 night.

Last week my friend and I were bored after three weeks of holidays, so 
we rode our bikes to Pasir Kencana Beach, which is only five kilometres 
from where I live. When we arrived at the beach, we were surprised to 
see there was hardly anyone there.<br /><br />After having a quick dip in 
the ocean, which was really cold, we realized one reason there were not 
many people there. It was also quite windy. After we bought some hot 
chips at the takeaway store nearby, we rode our bikes down the beach for
 a while, on the hard, damp part of the sand. We had the wind behind us 
and, before we knew it, we were many miles down the beach.<br /><br />Before
 we made the long trip back, we decided to paddle our feet in the water 
for a while, and then sit down for a rest. While we were sitting on the 
beach, just chatting, it suddenly dawned on us that all the way back, we
 would be riding into the strong wind.<br /><br />When we finally made it back home, we were both totally exhausted! But we learned some good lessons that day.
