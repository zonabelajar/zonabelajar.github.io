                        Fiona Famous<br /><br />Fiona Famous was a very popular girl at school. She was clever and fun, and got on well with everyone. It was no accident that Fiona was so popular. From an early age she had made an effort to be kind and friendly to everyone. She invited the whole class to her birthday party, and from time to time she would give presents to everybody. She was such a busy girl, with so many friends, that she hardly got a chance to spend time with individual friends. However, she felt very lucky; no other girl had so many friends at school and in the neighborhood.<br /><br />But everything changed on National Friendship Day. On that day, at school, everyone was having a great time, drawing, painting, giving gifts. That day in class everyone had to make three presents to give to their three best friends. Fiona enjoyed the task of choosing three from amongst all the dozens of her friends.<br /><br />However, when all the presents had been made and shared out among classmates, Fiona was the only one who had not received a present! She felt terrible, and spent hours crying. How could it be possible? So much effort to make so many friends, and in the end no one saw her as their best friend? Everyone came and tried to console her for a while. But each one only stayed for a short time before leaving.<br /><br />This was exactly what Fiona had done so many times to others.<br />She realized that she was a good companion and acquaintance, but she had not been a true friend to anyone. She had tried not to argue with anyone, she had tried to pay attention to everyone, but now she had found out that that was not enough to create true friendship.<br /><br />When she got home that night , created quite a puddle with her tears, and Fiona asked her mother where she could find true friends.<br />“Fiona, my dear,” answered her mother, “you cannot buy friends with a smile or a few good words. If you really want true friends, you will have to give them real time and affection. For a true friend you must always be available, in good times and bad”.<br /><br />“But I want to be everybody’s friend! I need to share my time among everyone!”, Fiona protested.<br />“My dear, you’re a lovely girl,” said her mother, “but you can’t be a close friend to everybody. There just isn’t enough time to be available for everyone, so it’s only possible to have a few true friends. The others will by playmates or acquaintances, but they won’t be close friends”.<br /><br />Hearing this, Fiona decided to change her ways so that she could finally have some true friends. That night, in bed, she thought about what she could do to get them.<br />She thought about her mother. Her mother was always willing to help her, she put up with all of Fiona’s dislikes and problems, she always forgave her, she loved her a great deal…<br />That was what makes friends! And Fiona smiled from ear to ear, realizing that she already had the best friend anyone could ever want.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>The fax and the turtle</strong></p><p></p><p>For want of a better meal, a starving fox captured a turtle, but then could not manage to break through the solid shell in order to eat it. "You should try putting me in the water for a while to soften me up." suggested the shrewd turtle.</p><p></p><p>This sounded like excellent advice to the fox. He carried his prey to the stream and immersed it in the current. The turtle, who was a superb swimmer, slid out of the fox's paws and re-emerged in mid stream laughing.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p><strong>An Old Man in the Village</strong>
</p><p>An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.
</p><p>
</p><p>The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.
</p><p>
</p><p>He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.
</p><p>
</p><p>But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour that the Old Man had become happy, he doesn’t complain about anything anymore, always smiles, and even his face is freshened up.
</p><p>
</p><p>The whole village gathered together. The villagers asked the old man about what happened.
</p><p>
</p><p>He answers, “Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.”
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Moral of the story: Jangan mengejar kebahagiaan. Nikmatilah hidupmu. </strong></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>To the Red I’ve Read
</p><p>
</p><p>Everything I ask, everything I read is about the world and anything I can take as a lesson. Today I read a story from a famous novel, about a woman who was kind, determined, and brave. Many feel unfamiliar with the woman, I will not mention who the character is, it’s just that I know her as Merah (she really is like red, has the ability to be blushing and flashy).
</p><p>
</p><p>On page 53, when the story is on the theme ‘Why You Struggle’, there is a sentence that I like the most, it says “because I am a woman, I can face it”. She was always opposed even by her family, they said women could not be alone, and did not need to be highly educated.
</p><p>
</p><p>I know what answer the Red will say, she will just smile with sparkling eyes. “I don’t like being ordinary, I’m happy to be a woman who is empowered, and increases humanity.”
</p><p>
</p><p>The story is still ongoing, want to hear my story further? Or maybe you’ve read the book yourself?</p><p><strong>SEMOGA MEMBANTU</strong></p><p></p><br />

                         The Cat and the Fox<br />Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the way -- a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there -- they began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal.<br />"You think you are extremely clever, don't you?" said the Fox. "Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks!"<br /><br />"Well," retorted the Cat, "I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!"<br /><br />Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves.<br /><br />"This is my trick," he called to the Fox. "Now let me see what yours are worth."<br /><br />But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows, but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks.<br /><br />

punched her until she can't attacked me anymore, i left my sandwich on the
bench for her. That's my bad experience<br /><br />Kemarin, saat aku menunggu
taxi, aku melihat seorang gadis duduk di bangku dekat tempat sampah kota dengan
tangan penuh sampah dan dia memakan sampah itu. Aku pikir bahwa dia kelaparan
dan tidak mempunyai uang untuk membeli makanan. Jadi, aku menghampirinya dan
duduk di bangku yang sama yang ia duduki. Dia menyeringai kepadaku, lalu aku
menawarkan sandwich ku kepadanya, tapi dia menolak dan menyerangku. Itu sangat

tidak bisa menyerangku lagi, aku meninggalkan sandwich ku di bangku itu
untuknya. Itu adalah pengalaman burukku<br /><br />Tandai Jawaban Ini Sebagai Jawaban Yang Terbaik :)<br /><br />
