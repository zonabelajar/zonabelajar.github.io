One day, the king went sailing accompanied by his loyal bodyguards. Along the way, the hurricane came. The guards begged the king to cancel his plan. “Sir, it is dangerous if we continue the journey with this condition. It’s better if we stop first to a safer place. If I am not mistaken, there is a place nearby here named Tumasik Island. “What if we stay there while waiting for a safer condition?” Said the captain of the ship. The king approved this opinion. Their boat was docked to Tumasik Island shortly afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Arriving on the island, King and several bodyguards left the ship and looked around the island. When they’re looking around, suddenly an animal which was not far from them flashed. The king was surprised and fascinated. The beast was so huge, looked dashing, and was golden in color.” What creature was that?” Asked the King to his guards. “If i am not mistaken, people call it “Singa”, your majesty,” one of his bodyguards replied. “What?” Asked the King to clarify. “Singa” replied the guard.</p><p></p><p>The king then asked more explanation about the animal. Attentively, The King listened to all explanations from his bodyguard about the animal. “Then, we give the name of this place “Singapore”.”Meaning: The City of Lion which is derived from malay “Singa” (lion) and “Pura / Pore” (City)”. Since that time the town was named Singapore.</p><p></p><p>Terjemahan</p><p></p><p>Asal Nama Singapura</p><p></p><p>Ratusan tahun yang lalu hiduplah seorang raja bernama Nila Utama, Raja Sriwijaya. Pada suatu hari, Raja pergi berlayar ditemani pengawal-pengawal setianya. Di tengah perjalanan, angin topan datang. Para pengawal memohon agar raja membatalkan niatnya. “Tuan, sungguh berbahaya jika kita meneruskan perjalanan dengan kondisi seperti ini. Lebih baik jika kita singgah dulu ke tempat yang lebih aman. Kalau hamba tak keliru, ada tempat terdekat dari sini yang bernama Pulau Tumasik. Bagaimana jika singgah di sana sembari menunggu kondisi yang lebih aman?” kata kapten kapal. Raja menyetujui pendapat tersebut. Perahu mereka pun merapat ke Pulau Tumasik tak lama setelah itu.</p><p>Sesampainya di pulau tersebut, Raja dan beberapa pengawalnya meninggalkan kapal dan berkeliling melihat-lihat pulau tersebut. Saat mereka sedang melihat-lihat sekeliling, tiba-tiba seekor binatang berkelebat tak jauh dari tempat mereka. Raja terkejut dan terpukau. Binatang itu sanagat besar, tampak gagah, dan berwarna keemasan. “Mahluk apakah itu?” tanya sang Raja kepada para pengawalnya. “Kalau hamba tak salah, orang-orang menyebutnya singa, Yang Mulia,” jawab salah seorang pengawalnya. “Apa?” tanya sang Raja memperjelas. “Singa” jawab pengawal tadi.</p><p>Raja lalu meminta penjelasan lebih banyak tentang biantang tersebut. Dengan penuh perhatian, Raja mendengarkan semua penjelasan pengawalnya tentang binatang itu. “Kalau begitu, kita beri nama tempat ini Singapura. Artinya: Kota Singa yang diperoh dari bahasa melayu “Singa” dan “Pura”. Sejak saat itulah kota itu bernama Singapura.</p><br />

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

The Monkeys and The Cap Seller 

<br />
Once,
 a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed
 to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed 
his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head. The
 cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first 
thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all
 his caps were not there.<br /><br /> 
            When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see 
monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is 
wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate himHe
 decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys.
 In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make 
gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br /><br /><br />
At
 last he found a clever idea. " Monkeys are a great imitator," he 
thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And
 as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the 
caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, 
put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />The Generic Structure of above Narrative Story Is :<br /><br />Orientation: The
 cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time 
setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion 
that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and 
where of the story.Complication: The
 cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do 
not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. 
Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That 
is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.Resolution: The
 cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing 
his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is 
solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps 
returned.<br /><br />

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at
once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?"

<br />

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
"Because he is not Phil Collins!"

lived a young man named Galoran. He was respected because of his wealth and
honor. His parents were nobleman so he could live with luxury. However, he was
very wasteful and every day just squandered the wealth of his parents.

<br /><br />

One day, his parents
died, but he did not care and continued to spend money as well as before.
Because his life was so extravagant, all the treasure that he had was running
out and he became an unemployed person. Many people sympathized with him and
offered a job. But every time he got the job, he just dallied and it made him
always be fired. Several months later, there was a wealthy widow who interested
him. He married the widow and of course, he was very happy to be living in
luxury again.

<br /><br />

The widow had a
daughter who was very diligent and clever to weave. Her name is Jambean, a
beautiful girl and had been famous because of her weaving. However, Galoran did
not like the girl, because the girl often scolded him because of his laziness.
Finally, he threatened to torture and kill Jambean. He revealed the plan to his
wife and the wife was very sad to hear of the threat.

<br /><br />

Hearing the news,
Jambean was very sad but she volunteered herself to be killed by her father.
She told that she wanted to be dumped into a dam and did not burry under the
ground after the death. The mother agreed and did all of her wants. In the dam,
her body and head suddenly turned into the golden slugs.

<br /><br />

Several years later,
there are two widows who were looking for firewood. They were kindred, the
first widow named Mbok Rondo Sambega and the second called Mbok Rondo Sembagil.
When looking for the firewood in the jungle, they were very surprised because
of finding the beautiful golden slugs. They brought it and maintained at home.

<br /><br />

Once they brought the
snails, there was always a miracle every day. Their kitchen was always filled
with the delicious food when they came home from work. They were very surprised,
and wanted to know the person who made those foods. They pretended to go to
work and hid in the back of the house. A few moments later, there was a
beautiful girl came from the inside of the conch and she began to cook the
delicious meals.

Both widows then
secretly held and did not let the girl to get into the snail anymore. The girl
apparently was Jambean who had been killed by her father. Both widows then
allowed her to stay with them. Because of their versatility in weaving, she got
her famous back and made a handsome prince attracted. In the end, she married
the prince and lived happily.
