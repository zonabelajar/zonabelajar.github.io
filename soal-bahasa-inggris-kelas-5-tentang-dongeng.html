The Legend of Tanjung Menangis 

(Cape Weeps)


<br />

Once upon a time there were a great empire on the island of Halmahera. 
King had recently died. He left two sons and one daughter. They named 
Majesty Arif, son Binaut Majesty and Majesty Princess Nuri. Binaut 
king’s sons really wanted the position as king to succeed his father. 
The desire was conveyed to the royal governor. “I had to replace the 
position of my father.” Said Binaut to the duke with confidence.

<br />

In order for the duke of supporting the plan, then Binaut gave promise 
that the office of the regent will be retained, and he will be rewarded 
gold diamond. Thanks persuasions and promises that, the duke agreed to 
support Binaut be king. The duke immediately set the royal guards to 
catch Majesty the Queen, Son and Daughter Sire Sire Arif Nuri. Once 
captured, they were thrown in the dungeon.

<br />

“Kanda Binaut really cruel! Greedy! Do not know myself! “Vituperation 
daughter Nuri sire with great emotion. However, Majesty Queen requested 
that Nuri patience and resignation in the face of this ordeal. “The 
truth will seem right and wrong will seem wrong. And the one that would 
later receive a just punishment, “said Majesty the Queen entertains with
 full of motherhood, how very hurt to see his biological son atrocities.

<br />

Binaut feel excited after plunging mother and siblings to prison. He 
announced to the people that the royal Majesty the Queen and their 
children experiencing disaster at sea. At that, the king’s son Binaut 
ask the court to the authorities immediately sworn in as king. Since 
then, the King Binaut being arrogant and snobby. He is considered as the
 most powerful king on earth.

<br />

For the benefit of himself, he ordered all the people of the kingdom to 
work diligently to build a magnificent palace. In addition, various 
levies imposed taxes, including taxes crops, animal tax, land tax. 
“Unbelievable! King Binaut exploiters and oppressors of the people, 
“said one resident to another. They complained to the regulations issued
 by the King Binaut extremely detrimental to the people. However, they 
are afraid to protest, let alone stand up to the king, must be punished 
heavily.

<br />

There was a palace maid named Wisdom. He escaped from the palace and 
form a formidable force against the king Binaut. At the very least, they
 can free Majesty the Queen and her son and daughter. “We must act 
quickly to save them,” Wise said hopefully. This is supported by his 
friends.

<br />

At that time, many court officials who have defected to join the Wise. 
Wise had been studying how the rescue was conducted. If rescue is 
successful, planned conduct incursions into the court of King Binaut. 
Thanks to the wise leadership, in an instant they had rescued Majesty 
the Queen and her children were imprisoned Binaut. They were immediately
 taken to the woods.

<br />

“I thanked infinite,” said Majesty the Queen with a hiccup. They look 
emaciated because during incarceration in the basement rarely eat and 
drink. Wise also convey to Your Majesty the Queen will hold the attack 
on the palace. But Majesty the Queen does not agree, he did not want 
blood on their own people. Greed, cruelty, envy and jealousy to be 
inferior to that submitted petitions to the Lord.

<br />

King Binaut apply arbitrarily to its people. The duke who has always 
supported the King’s decision eventually Binaut not happy with the 
behavior of the King. But he did not dare to issue a stance against. If 
that made sure he was fired and thrown in jail. When the prison was 
filled with the detainees. “Who against King, punishment penjaralah 
place.” That arrogance King Binaut. Because he was the most powerful and
 high.

<br />

Namn unexpectedly, a natural disaster occurs. A very powerful volcanic 
eruption. Hot lava flows in all directions. Binaut King’s Palace was the
 subject of hot lava. Apparently most of the hot lava had devastating 
devastated palace buildings newly constructed from the sweat of the 
people. King Binaut confusion for cover. He ran helter-skelter not 
knowing where to go.

<br />

Surprisingly, lava as if chasing wherever the King Binaut run. 
“Please-please!” Cried Binaut. Hot lava that gradually Binaut foot 
stuck. Immediately his feet blistered and peeling skin. He tried to not 
stop running. Hot lava began to creep into his body. He was tortured. 
When he suffered torture hot lava that he remembers his mother. He 
begged forgiveness. “Forgive me, Mom! Excuse me, ma’am! I can not endure
 this suffering! I will not betray my mother, brother and sister Arif 
Nuri again. Please forgive me! Mom! Mom! “Shouted Binaut pain. But the 
cry is lost slowly and eventually he died.

<br />

Binaut’s body washed up on a beach. Immediately the place was turned 
into a cape. That said, the cape was often heard people crying for mercy
 because they suffered extreme torture. Now the place was called the 
Cape terdamparnya Binaut Crying<br /><br />

In fact, he only intended to pretend and lied.<br />One day, he wanted to drink the water in the river which was deep enough. Because he was so thirsty, he did not pay attention to the depth of the river and immediately stuck his trunk into the water. The surfaces that were near the river were so slippery but he did not pay attention. Suddenly, Danny slipped and he plunged into the river. There was no elephant that was near river because they were all in the pasture which was far enough away from the river. He then yelled very loudly and asked for help to all the elephants.<br />The elephants heard it, but he often lied, so that the elephants on the pasture ignored his scream. In fact, his parents did not pay attention because they thought he was lying. However, his brother was curious and wanted to see whether Danny was lying or not. When the brother reached the river, he saw that Danny was not lying and Danny almost drowned.<br />Andy immediately saved Danny and took him out on the pasture to be treated.

Anak pertama mereka adalah Andy dan anak kedua mereka adalah Danny. Danny adalah gajah yang sering berbohong dan ia selalu dimarahi oleh orang tuanya karena kebohongan-kebohongan yang sering ia lakukan.<br />Sedangkan anak pertama mereka, Andy merupakan seekor gajah yang sangat jujur dan sangat dibanggakan oleh orang tuanya. Namun, meski ia dibanggakan oleh orang tuanya, ia tidak sombong sehingga semua gajah semakin menyukai Andy. Semua kondisi tersebut membuat Danny iri dan tidak menyukai kakaknya. Sikap iri yang ia miliki tidak membuatnya berubah dan ia menjadi semakin sering berbohong. Ia tidak pernah jera meskipun sering dihukum oleh orang tuanya.<br />Sementara itu, kakaknya, Andy tidak pernah bosan dan berhenti untuk menasehatinya. Namun, semua nasihat dan hukuman yang ia terima tidak pernah membuat dirinya jera. Salah satu kebohongan yang sering dilakukan olehnya adalah berteriak-teriak di dekat sungai agar orang lain mengira dirinya tenggelam. Padahal, ia hanya berpura-pura dan bermaksud berbohong.<br />Pada suatu hari, ia ingin minum air yang ada di sungai yang cukup dalam. Karena begitu haus, ia tidak memperhatikan kedalaman sungai tersebut dan langsung menjulurkan belalainya ke dalam air. Permukaan yang ada di dekat sungai begitu licin namun ia tidak memperdulikannya. Tiba-tiba, Danny terpeleset dan ia tercebur ke dalam sungai. Tidak ada satu ekorpun gajah yang berada di dekat sungai karena mereka semua sedang berada di padang rumput yang cukup jauh dari sungai tersebut. Ia kemudian berteriak dengan sangat keras dan meminta tolong kepada semua gajah.<br />Para gajah mendengarnya, namun karena ia sering berbohong, maka gajah-gajah yang sedang berada di padang rumput tidak memperdulikannya. Bahkan, orang tuanya tidak memperdulikannya karena mengira ia sedang berbohong. Namun, kakaknya penasaran dan ingin melihat apakah danny berbohong atau tidak. Ketika sampai di sungai, ternyata Danny tidak berbohong dan ia hampir mati tenggelam.<br />Andy segera menyelamatkan Danny dan membawanya ke padang rumput untuk diobati. Para gajah yang ada di padang rumput terkejut dan segera berkerumun di samping danny.

                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a horse who lived in a lush green meadow. He was strong, majestic, and loved to run free. One day, while galloping in the field, he came across a snail who was slowly making its way across the grass.</p><p></p><p>The horse was amused and asked the snail, "Why are you moving so slowly? Why don't you run like me?"</p><p></p><p>The snail replied, "I may not be as fast as you, but I have a home on my back wherever I go."</p><p></p><p>The horse thought about this and realized that the snail was right. As fast as he was, he didn't have a home to call his own. So, he asked the snail, "Can I come with you and share your home?"</p><p></p><p>The snail agreed, and the horse joined him on his journey. They became the best of friends, and the horse learned to appreciate the small things in life, like the beauty of the flowers he had never noticed before.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the horse and the snail traveled together, exploring the world at their own pace, and they lived happily ever after.</p><p></p><p>Penjelasan:</p><p>Cerita ini tentang perlombaan antara seekor kuda dan seekor siput. Kuda, yang cepat dan percaya diri, menantang siput yang bergerak lambat untuk balapan. Siput, meskipun direndahkan oleh kuda, menerima tantangan tersebut.</p><p></p><p>Selama perlombaan, kuda dengan cepat memimpin, meninggalkan siput jauh di belakang. Namun, ketika kuda mendekati garis finish, kuda terkejut melihat bahwa siput telah memenangkan perlombaan. Siput telah mengambil jalan pintas dengan merangkak di bawah rumput, sementara kuda harus berlari mengelilinginya.</p><p></p><p>Moral dari cerita ini adalah bahwa tidak selalu orang yang tercepat atau terkuat yang menang. Kadang-kadang, mereka yang sabar, bertekad, dan cerdas dapat mengatasi rintangan yang tampaknya tidak teratasi dan mencapai kesuksesan.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>There was once a hunter who, on the seventh birthday of his son, decided to go hunting to get something nice for the feast. But as he reached for the gun on the wall, it slipped from the pegs, hit the stone mortar below and alas, its barrel was bent like the letter L.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Father, that’s a bad sign,” cried the boy, “please don’t go hunting today.”
</p><p>“You are silly!” said the father. “That’s a good sign. The gun hit the mortar. That means it’ll hit the game, too.”</p><br /><p>The father went out and came to a mountain lake while it was still quite early. What do you think he saw? Wild ducks–thirteen of them! Twelve were splashing in the water, and the thirteenth was sleeping quietly on the shore beside a rock.
</p><p>
</p><p>“What luck!” said the hunter to himself, and he aimed at one of the ducks with his crooked gun.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Bang!” went the shot. Lo and behold, as the gun barrel was crooked, the bullet that he shot out went zig-zag-zig-zag, hitting all twelve ducks in the water and then hitting the rock beside which the thirteenth was asleep. As it rebounded, the bullet hit the thirteenth duck, only wounding it.</p><br /><p>The duck fell in the water and began flapping its wings wildly. The hunter waded through the water to catch it. It was only with great difficulty that he got to the duck, for he wore baggy cotton pants and thick leg-guards made of straw.
</p><p>
</p><p>When he finally got hold of the duck by the neck, it hit the water with a last desperate flap of the wings. Then – splash! Something jumped out of the water and landed among the bush near the beach. And guess what — it was a huge carp, the largest and most delicious-looking one he ever seen.
</p><p>
</p><p>“I must catch it now,” said the hunter and grasped some roots of a tree at hand to help himself get out of the water. Well, what he took for roots were actually the hind legs of a great big hare! In its frantic efforts to free himself, the hare dug out with its front paws twenty-five fat yams from under the ground!</p><br /><p>The hunter went into the bush to pick up the carp, and there he found out that the fish had landed in a pheasant nest. The fowl was lying dead with its neck broken by the fish. When the hunter took the fowl, it uncovered thirteen eggs snugly tucked in the soft leaves. Not even one was broken. The hunter carefully raked aside the leaves to get the eggs, and numerous mushrooms appeared from under the leaves!</p><br /><p>The hare and the pheasant went onto the hunter’s right shoulder, the carp and the yams on the left, the ducks all around the waist, the eggs under his shirt, and the mushrooms into a bag. Then he went home with his crooked gun.
</p><p>As soon as he reached home, he took off his leg-guards and pants because they were wet and uncomfortable. Another surprise! From his leg-guards poured out shrimps just too many to count, and from his cotton pants, thirty-three crucians still alive. They spread all over the floor, jumping and dancing.
</p><p>
</p><p>Well, you can imagine what a gorgeous feast the hunter’s son had for his seventh birthday! All the people in the neighbourhood were invited and everyone feasted until he couldn’t eat any more!</p><br /><br /><br />

                         The Cat and the Fox<br />Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the way -- a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there -- they began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal.<br />"You think you are extremely clever, don't you?" said the Fox. "Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks!"<br /><br />"Well," retorted the Cat, "I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!"<br /><br />Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves.<br /><br />"This is my trick," he called to the Fox. "Now let me see what yours are worth."<br /><br />But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows, but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks.<br /><br />

                        Mouse Deer and CrocodileOne day, Mouse Deer 
went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile 
might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. “I wonder 
if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.” Of course Mouse 
Deer didn’t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end
 into the water. Chomp…! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it 
underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. “Ha… ha…ha… Stupid crocodile! Cant you 
tell the difference between a stick and a leg?” Then Mouse Deer ran off 
to drink somewhere else.In the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to 
cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the 
river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked
 like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn’t want to be eaten by 
Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud,
 “Crocodile!” Crocodile rose from the water, “Hello, Mouse Deer. Have 
you come to be my lunch?” Mouse Deer smiled. “Sorry, not today, 
Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the 
crocodiles in this river to a party. He wants me to count all the 
crocodiles so he could prepare enough meal for you.”“Really…? 
Tell us what to do,” said Crocodile. “You must line up from this side of
 the river to the other side,” said Mouse Deer. Crocodile then got all 
his friends and family. They lined up across the river. Mouse Deer then 
jumped onto Crocodile’s back. “One,” he counted. He jumped onto the next
 crocodile, “Two.” And the next crocodile, “Three.” Mouse Deer kept 
jumping until he arrived on the other side of the river. “How many are 
there?” asked Crocodile. “Just enough,” said Mouse Deer. He laughed as 
he ran to the forest<br />Si Kancil tale The Proud Peacock and Chickens - One day the deer were playing in the woods, from a distance came the peacock. The Peacock comes with a stretched tail very large and beautiful color. Occasional peacock wag its tail to the attention of the other forest animals. <br />"Hi deer, look at my tail, do not you see my tail bowled very beautiful and gorgeous is this?" asked the peacock to the deer that was lying under a tree. Apparently the Kancil so stuffed after eating cucumbers from the garden this afternoon farmers pack. "Ah ordinary tuh, it is not much different tail with the tail of our friends the other", said the deer casually. <br /><br /><br /><br />"The hell, all animals of this jungle like and admire my beautiful tail of this, you only have cil who do not want to admit it", upset the peacock to the deer. <br />The deer was disturbed his nap time the Peacock was forced mngelabui order not arrogant anymore. "Do you know the Peacock, yesterday I saw a hunter chasing a beautiful peacock tail pieces and sell to them?". <br />Not yet finished hare told Peacock. The peacock is much ran headlong abandon the Kancil. "Ohh Tidakk.aku not want searchers hunted by my tail this gorgeous .."<br />See the behavior of the peacock, the Kancil could only laugh and resumed his nap. <br />Thankful for what we have is the wisdom of the hare story today.

                        After dinner I overheard the guides talking. They were worked up about something. Apparently, one of them had seen Cowhorn.<br /><br />“Who’s Cowhorn?” I asked.<br /><br />“Dude, Cowhorn is a legend.”<br /><br />Since they’d first seen Cowhorn, years ago, the buck had only ever grown a spike on his left side—a heavy, sweeping dagger, like the horn of a cow. His right side, meanwhile, was so enormous that any hunter who saw him, no matter how discriminating, let fly.<br /><br />Cowhorn, the guides said, was the most shot-at buck in the camp’s history. During the previous fall alone, when the 6-year-old deer was already declining, hunters took no less than 11 cracks at him—all with scoped rifles, a couple under 50 yards.<br /><br />Not one shot parted a hair.<br /><br />“That buck can’t be killed,” one of guides said flatly.<br /><br />Suddenly, I really wanted to hunt this deer. The guides warned me that he’d gone way downhill since last year—wouldn’t score much now. That didn’t matter. I wanted Cowhorn.<br />
