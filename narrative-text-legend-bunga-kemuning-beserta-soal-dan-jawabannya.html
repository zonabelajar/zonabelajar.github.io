                        The Myth of Dewi Sri<br /><br />Once upon a time, Batara Guru commanded all the gods and goddesses to contribute their power in order to build a new palace. Anybody who disobeyed this commandment were considered lazy and would lose their arms and legs.<br />Hearing the Batara Guru’s commandment, Naga god was very anxious because he didn’t have arms or legs. He might not be able do the job. So he asked advice from Batara Narada who was the younger brother of Batara Guru. Unfortunately Narada was also confused. The Naga god became very upset.<br />While the Naga god was crying for his bad luck, three teardrops fell on the ground. Not long after that, those teardrops became three beautiful shining eggs which looked like jewels. Then Batara Narada advised him to offer those shining eggs to Batara Guru.<br />With the three eggs in his mouth, the Naga god went to the Batara Guru’s palace. On the way, an eagle asked him a question. Surely Naga god could not answer the question because he was holding the eggs in his mouth. Seeing that, the bird thought that Naga god was arrogant and the bird attacked him.<br />Being attacked, one egg fell to earth. Then Naga god was hiding in the bushes but the bird was waiting for him. The bird attacked for the second time and one egg fell again. So Naga god only had one egg in his mouth. He kept moving to Batara Guru’s palace.<br />Finally Naga god arrived at the palace. He offered the egg to the Batara Guru. And miraculously the egg hatched became a very beautiful baby girl. Naga god gave the baby girl to the Batara Guru. The baby grew up into a beautiful girl and later known for Dewi Sri.<br /><br /><br />Semoga membantu :)<br />

He could not believe his eyes. “I am not an ugly duckling but a beautiful swam” he exclaimed.<br /><br />He was very happy. From that day on, he swam and played with his new friends and was happier than he had never been.<br /><br />Coda:<br /><br />            Dont judge someone from their physic.<br />

                        Beauty and the beast<br /><br />
Once
 upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his 
three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The 
first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but 
the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest 
of them all, said to her father:  



 "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   

<br /> When
 the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a
 sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the 
howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching
 an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of
 a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   

"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. 

<br /> When
 he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody 
came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling 
out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner
 lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner
 of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />
Overcome
 by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into 
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a 
soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could 
not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. 

<br /> When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.  The
 merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
 thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was 
nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it 
all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to
 a tree.<br />soal:1. who is the antagonist act on the story?2. how can the beast return to a handsome person?<br /><br /><br />

lived a young man named Galoran. He was respected because of his wealth and
honor. His parents were nobleman so he could live with luxury. However, he was
very wasteful and every day just squandered the wealth of his parents.

<br /><br />

One day, his parents
died, but he did not care and continued to spend money as well as before.
Because his life was so extravagant, all the treasure that he had was running
out and he became an unemployed person. Many people sympathized with him and
offered a job. But every time he got the job, he just dallied and it made him
always be fired. Several months later, there was a wealthy widow who interested
him. He married the widow and of course, he was very happy to be living in
luxury again.

<br /><br />

The widow had a
daughter who was very diligent and clever to weave. Her name is Jambean, a
beautiful girl and had been famous because of her weaving. However, Galoran did
not like the girl, because the girl often scolded him because of his laziness.
Finally, he threatened to torture and kill Jambean. He revealed the plan to his
wife and the wife was very sad to hear of the threat.

<br /><br />

Hearing the news,
Jambean was very sad but she volunteered herself to be killed by her father.
She told that she wanted to be dumped into a dam and did not burry under the
ground after the death. The mother agreed and did all of her wants. In the dam,
her body and head suddenly turned into the golden slugs.

<br /><br />

Several years later,
there are two widows who were looking for firewood. They were kindred, the
first widow named Mbok Rondo Sambega and the second called Mbok Rondo Sembagil.
When looking for the firewood in the jungle, they were very surprised because
of finding the beautiful golden slugs. They brought it and maintained at home.

<br /><br />

Once they brought the
snails, there was always a miracle every day. Their kitchen was always filled
with the delicious food when they came home from work. They were very surprised,
and wanted to know the person who made those foods. They pretended to go to
work and hid in the back of the house. A few moments later, there was a
beautiful girl came from the inside of the conch and she began to cook the
delicious meals.

Both widows then
secretly held and did not let the girl to get into the snail anymore. The girl
apparently was Jambean who had been killed by her father. Both widows then
allowed her to stay with them. Because of their versatility in weaving, she got
her famous back and made a handsome prince attracted. In the end, she married
the prince and lived happily.

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at
once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?"

<br />

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
"Because he is not Phil Collins!"

The Monkeys and The Cap Seller 

<br />
Once,
 a cap seller was passing through a jungle. He was very tired and needed
 to rest. Then, he stopped and spread a cloth under a tree. He placed 
his bag full of caps near him and lay down with his cap on his head. The
 cap seller had a sound sleep for one hour. When he got up, the first 
thing he did was to look into his bag. He was startled when he found all
 his caps were not there.<br /><br /> 
            When he looked up the sky, he was very surprised to see 
monkeys sitting on the branches of a tree, each of the monkeys is 
wearing a cap of on its head. They had evidently done it to imitate himHe
 decided to get his caps back by making a humble request to the monkeys.
 In return, the monkeys only made faces of him. When he begun to make 
gesture, the monkeys also imitated him.<br /><br /><br />
At
 last he found a clever idea. " Monkeys are a great imitator," he 
thought. So he took off his own cap and threw it down on the ground. And
 as he had expected, all the monkeys took off the caps and threw the 
caps down on the ground. Quickly, he stood up and collected the caps, 
put them back into his bag and went away.<br /><br />The Generic Structure of above Narrative Story Is :<br /><br />Orientation: The
 cap seller as the participant (main character), once time as time 
setting, and in the jungle as place setting. We note from discussion 
that the elements of orientation is shortly answering who, when and 
where of the story.Complication: The
 cap seller wants the monkeys to bring back his caps but the monkeys do 
not return them. Of course this makes the cap seller face a problem. 
Complication in a narrative text is not always in single problem. That 
is we know a major conflict and minor conflict.Resolution: The
 cap seller gets the monkey to bring back the cap by acting of throwing 
his own cap. The monkeys imitate what he has done so the problem is is 
solved. This story has happy ending as the cap seller has his caps 
returned.<br /><br />

He ordered the Sheriff, to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and his friend, Little John. They would steal the tax money from sheriff and give it back to the poor.<br /><br />One day, the king was traveling. He was so busy counting his gold . He didn’t notice that he was passing through the Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see two pairs of eyes that watching him from the tree.<br /><br />“Look at those gold, Little John! Let’s pay the King a little visit, shall we?” Robin said.<br /><br />Inside the coach, the King was singing happily.<br /><br />“Golden Golden, I love things made of Gold… from top of my crown ‘till the tip of my toes”<br /><br />Robin hood were standing by the road-side as he disguised himself as a fortune teller. The King saw him and got interested. Therefore he asked ‘the lady’ to tell him about his fortune.<br /><br />“Ooh~ A long life with lots and lots of gold. Such a wonderful future” Robin said.<br /><br />“Of course! Gold is the most beautiful thing in the world” The King said excitedly. He didn’t realize that Little John is taking his gold.<br /><br />And so, the two manage to get all of the gold without getting caught.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the village, the Sheriff was busy collecting taxes.<br /><br />“I must have more taxes! Hand over those gold!” the Sheriff said.<br /><br />“No! please don’t! We need these gold!” a girl said.<br /><br />“This is the king’s order! You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” the Sheriff said.<br /><br />“Hu huhu… No… But… uh-!” in the end, The Sheriff took the gold by force.<br /><br />Not long after The Sheriff left, Robin came.<br /><br />“What’s wrong little girl? Why are you crying?” Robin asked.<br /><br />“The Sheriff… He took all of our golds.” The girl said.<br /><br />“Oo De Lally~! you don’t have to worry then, little girl. Here, I have a lot more for you” Robin said.<br /><br />“this one for you, this one for you, this one for you, and this one, woops, I think I just ran out of gold. Well then, for you my lady, what about a rose?”<br /><br />In the end, everyone’s happy.<br /><br />Later then, Little John told Robin Hood that the King was having an archery tournament by tomorrow. And he promised a great prize for the winner. Hearing this, Robin Hood decided to join in.<br /><br />The next day, the tournament was held. It was actually not an ordinary tournament. The King was planning on capturing Robin Hood because he knew that Robin hood was good at archery.<br /><br />But, Robin Hood was smart. He came with another disguise so no one notice that he was Robin Hood. The tournament then soon began.<br /><br />Most of the contestant had failed. And now, there’s only 2 people with one of them was Robin Hood.<br /><br />The first contestant shot. but it didn’t hit the target. And now, it’s Robin’s turn. He takes a deep breath before then he shot. It hits the bullseye! The crowds went hype.<br /><br />And that is when, the Sheriff realize. “Get that man! He is Robin Hood!” he shouted. But it was all too late, because Robin Hood had successfully escaped. Unknown to the Sheriff and the king, their gold had being taken once again<br /><br />After all, the tournament was only a distraction…<br /><br />===The End===<br /><br />

You are greedy” said Sura. Then they fought for the goat. After several hours, they were very tired.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Feeling tired of fighting, they lived in the different places. Sura lived in the water and Baya lived in the land. The border was the beach, so they would never fight again.</p><p></p><p>One day, Sura went to the land and looked for some food in the river. He was very hungry and there was not much food in the sea. Baya was very angry when he knew that Sura broke the promise. They fought again.</p><p></p><p>They both hit each other.
