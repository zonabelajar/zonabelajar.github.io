                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        CINDERELLA<br /><br /><p>One day, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with a
 wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very
 bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s 
palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her 
stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, 
they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the 
party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she 
did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a
 party and left Cinderella alone at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy 
godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball 
now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a
 dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be 
worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into 
the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy 
godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly 
Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and 
said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother
 then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden
 four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy 
Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, 
because this magic will works only until midnight!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her 
beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so 
different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass 
slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He 
met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I 
want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night 
and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother 
warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last 
moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and 
went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass 
slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the 
clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous 
shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress 
anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked 
about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very 
curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in 
love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even 
did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he 
said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into 
this glass slipper!”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the 
existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the 
size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper 
but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her 
stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let 
her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect 
leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced 
that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married 
Cinderella and they lived happily.</p><br /><br /><br />

                        <p>An example of an analytical expository essay prompt and response in English might be:</p><p></p><p>Prompt: Analyze the causes and effects of air pollution in major cities around the world.</p><p></p><p>Response:</p><p></p><p>Air pollution is a major problem in many cities around the world, with harmful effects on human health and the environment. There are several causes of air pollution in cities, including the burning of fossil fuels by vehicles, factories, and power plants, as well as the release of gases and particles from various sources such as agriculture and waste disposal.</p><p></p><p>One of the main causes of air pollution in cities is the high volume of vehicles on the roads. The burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel releases harmful gases and particulate matter into the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues in humans. In addition, the construction and operation of roads and highways can contribute to air pollution through the release of dust and other particles.</p><p></p><p>Another major cause of air pollution in cities is the presence of industrial facilities, such as factories and power plants. These facilities often release large amounts of gases and particles into the air, which can have serious health impacts on nearby residents. In addition, the use of fossil fuels by these facilities contributes to climate change, which is another major environmental concern.</p><p></p><p>The effects of air pollution on human health can be severe, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Exposure to air pollution can also have negative effects on the environment, such as damage to forests and other ecosystems. Additionally, air pollution can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, which can damage crops and other vegetation.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the causes and effects of air pollution in cities are complex and interconnected, but it is clear that action must be taken to reduce the harmful impacts of this problem. This may include measures such as regulating emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities, promoting the use of clean energy sources, and implementing policies to reduce air pollution and protect public health.</p><p></p><br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

                        I personally believe that libraries are among humanity’s most important institutions for several reasons.<br />Firstly, most of humanity’s collective knowledge is stored in libraries. Secondly, libraries protect and preserve this knowledge. They also classify or group the materials into logical and easily available divisions.<br />Furthermore, libraries make the materials available to everyone and even provide librarians to help us find what we need.<br />Finally, libraries are our link to the past and our gift to the future.<br />From the facts above, I conclude that libraries are important institutions for humanity. <br /><br />   what is the importance of library?? <br />

life?'<br /><br />
The lion looked at the tiny mouse and laughed.
'You save my life? What an absurd idea!' he said scornfully. 'But you have made
me laugh, and put me into a good mood again, so I shall let you go.' And the
lion opened his claws and let the mouse go free.<br /><br />
'Oh thank you, your majesty,' squeaked the mouse,
and scurried away as fast as he could.<br /><br />
A few days later the lion was caught in a hunter's
snare. Struggle as he might, he couldn't break free and became even more
entangled in the net of ropes. He let out a roar of anger that shook the
forest. Every animal heard it, including the tiny mouse.<br /><br />
The mouse was rushing to the source of its roar
and he found the lion was powerless. The mouse then bit the rope that cought
the lion so that the lion can escape from the trap. The lions are very grateful
to the mouse, and they became friends best forever.</p><p>                                 Seekor Tikus dan Seekor Singa<br /></p><p>Suatu ketika ada seekor singa yang sedang berbaring
tidur di sarangnya, tikus kecil nakal berlari ke ekornya, ke punggunya, ke
surainya dan menari serta melompat di kepalanya, sehingga singa itu pun
terbangun.<br /><br />
singa marah menerkam tikus tersebut dan memegangnya dalam
kuku-kukunya yang besar, meraung dalam kemarahan. "Berani-beraninya kau
membangunkan saya! Tidak tahukah kamu bahwa saualah Raja semua binatang?
Siapapun yang mengganggu istirahat saya layak mati! Saya akan membunuhmu dan
makanmu!'<br /><br />
Tikus tersebut ketakutan dan gemetaran, memohon agar sang
singa untuk membiarkannya pergi. 'Tolong jangan makan saya Yang Mulia! Saya
tidak bermaksud untuk membangunkan Anda, itu adalah sebuah kesalahan. Saya
hanya bermain. Tolong biarkan saya pergi - dan saya berjanji akan menjadi teman
Anda selamanya. Siapa tahu suatu hari saya bisa menyelamatkan hidup Anda?'<br /><br />
Singa menatap tikus kecil tersebut dan tertawa. "Kau
menyelamatkan hidup saya? Apa ide tidak masuk akal!" katanya mencemooh.
"Tapi kamu telah membuat saya tertawa, dan menempatkan saya ke dalam
suasana hati yang baik lagi, jadi saya akan membiarkan kamu pergi." Dan
singa membuka cakarnya dan membiarkan tikus itu pergi bebas.<br /><br />
"Oh terima kasih, Yang Mulia, 'decit tikus tersebut, dan
bergegas pergi secepat yang dia bisa.<br /><br />
Beberapa hari kemudian singa itu tertangkap dalam jerat
pemburu. Ia berjuang sebisa mungkin, ia tidak mampu melepaskan diri dan bahkan
menjadi lebih terjerat dalam jaring tali terseubt. Dia mengeluarkan raungan
kemarahan yang mengguncang hutan. Setiap hewan mendengarnya, termasuk tikus
kecil tersebut.<br /><br />Tikus itu pun bergegas menuju ke sumber aungan tersebut dan
ia mendapati sang singa sudah tidak berdaya. Tikus tersebut kemudian menggigit
tali yang menjerat singa sampai putus sehingga sang singa bisa lepas dari jerat
perangkap tersebut. Sang singa sangat berterima kasih pada tikus tersebut, dan
merekapun menjadi teman sejati selamanya.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>smoga membantu..tandai sbg jawaban terbaik ya</p><br />

                        Indonesian Cultural Existence almost Disappears in its Own Home<p>Indonesia is a country that has various cultures. This culture diversity occurs because Indonesia country consists of hundreds of islands where each island has its own culture. However, currently Indonesian culture is in danger of being lost because eroded by the times. There are so many factor that make Indonesia’s culture is in danger. Those factors are from inside and outside. Through this paper, the authors will describe those factors that cause the endangerment of native Indonesian culture. Here are two paragraphs that discussing those factors:</p><p>The first is factor from inside. The decreasing of Indonesia’s culture existence in its own home is caused by its own people that ignore their culture especially for teenagers. They are lulled by modern life and started to forget the values which is inherited by their ancestors. For example, local languages, cultural ceremony, customs and Indonesian traditions have been lost in society. Now, we could see no one wants to use local language because they are embarrassed called plebeian. Besides the teenagers who do not care anymore with the culture, government also less responsive in dealing with this problem. There is no real attempt from government to sustain Indonesians culture.</p><p>The second is external factors. The Rapid flow of information which comes to Indonesia also effects the erosion of Indonesian culture. Many foreign cultures, especially Western cultures have come and grew in Indonesia. Those western cultures are incompatible with the Indonesians values as eastern nations. It also gives bad effect in Indonesian’s norm as eastern nation. Nowadays, we can see the fashions of clothing that does not conform to the norms, habits drunk, and poor lifestyle has grown in Indonesia.</p><p>In short, the reduction of Indonesian culture existence in his own country as a result of several factors. They are inside and outside factors. For maintaining the continuity of Indonesia’s Culture, let us keep our own culture. Especially we as young people do not feel embarrassed to preserve our culture and also stem western cultures which come into our country. If we have lost our original culture means we have lost our own national identity.</p><br />

Despite a Dog, Tumang actually an incarnation of the god and the father of Sangkuriang.<br /><br />One day, he got mad at Tumang for not pursuing the animals. Because of so angry, he then expelled Tumang so the dog went into the woods.<br /><br />He then returned to the palace and told the incident to her mother. Dayang Sumbi was so angry and hit his head. Sangkuriang then disappointed and he decided to wander.<br /><br />After hitting Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi felt so sorry and she always prayed and meditated to get forgiveness from God. One day, God gave a gift because she was so diligent in praying. The prize is a timeless beauty that would make Sumbi Dayang becoming young forever.<br /><br />After wandering for a dozen years, Sangkuriang returned home. When he reached the kingdom, all had changed. He did not know what was happening. One day, he met a girl who was so beautiful. The girl was actually a Sumbi Dayang, his own mother.<br /><br />Sangkurian fell in love with the girl and then proposed her. Because of the handsomeness that was owned by Sangkuriang, then Dayang Sumbi also fell in love. One day, Sangkuriang want to hunt and he asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the headband. However, Dayang Sumbi surprised that her future husband had a head injury. Dayang Sumbi then realized that was the same injury as her son who wandered away. She then noticed Sangkuriang face, and she was more surprised to realize that her husband was Sangkuriang, her own son.<br /><br />After those happenings, she immediately looked for ways to thwart the plan of making a proposal. She then proposed two requirements to Sangkuriang. First, Sangkuriang should stem the Citarum River. Secondly, she asked Sangkuriang to make a big canoe to cross the river. Both of those conditions should be finished before sunrise.<br /><br />At night, Sangkuriang asked for help to spirit creatures to complete all the work. Dayang Sumbi secretly peeked at the job. Once the work was almost complete, Dayang Sumbi ordered his forces to hold a very long red carpet to the east of the city.<br /><br />The carpet made ​​the light became red and Sangkuriang thought that the sun had risen. He stopped his work and was very upset because all could not meet the requirements posed by Dayang Sumbi. Using his strength, Sangkuriang broke the dam and the city became flooding. His big canoe then crashed upside down and changed into a mountain named, Tangkuban Perahu.<br /><br /><br />
