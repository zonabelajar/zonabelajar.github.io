                        <p>                                                A Mouse and A Lion</p><p>Once, as a lion lay
sleeping in his den, a naughty little mouse ran up his tail, onto his back, up
his mane and danced and jumped on his head, so that the lion woke up.<br /><br />
lion angry grabbed the mouse and, holding him in
his large claws, roared in anger. 'How dare you wake me up! Don't you know that
I am King of the Beasts? Anyone who disturbs my rest deserves to die! I shall
kill you and eat you!'<br /><br />
The terrified mouse, shaking and trembling, begged
the lion to let him go. 'Please don't eat me Your Majesty! I did not mean to
wake you, it was a mistake. I was only playing. Please let me go - and I
promise I will be your friend forever. Who knows but one day I could save your
life?'<br /><br />
The lion looked at the tiny mouse and laughed.
'You save my life? What an absurd idea!' he said scornfully. 'But you have made
me laugh, and put me into a good mood again, so I shall let you go.' And the
lion opened his claws and let the mouse go free.<br /><br />
'Oh thank you, your majesty,' squeaked the mouse,
and scurried away as fast as he could.<br /><br />
A few days later the lion was caught in a hunter's
snare. Struggle as he might, he couldn't break free and became even more
entangled in the net of ropes. He let out a roar of anger that shook the
forest. Every animal heard it, including the tiny mouse.<br /><br />
The mouse was rushing to the source of its roar
and he found the lion was powerless. The mouse then bit the rope that cought
the lion so that the lion can escape from the trap. The lions are very grateful
to the mouse, and they became friends best forever.</p><p>                                 Seekor Tikus dan Seekor Singa<br /></p><p>Suatu ketika ada seekor singa yang sedang berbaring
tidur di sarangnya, tikus kecil nakal berlari ke ekornya, ke punggunya, ke
surainya dan menari serta melompat di kepalanya, sehingga singa itu pun
terbangun.<br /><br />
singa marah menerkam tikus tersebut dan memegangnya dalam
kuku-kukunya yang besar, meraung dalam kemarahan. "Berani-beraninya kau
membangunkan saya! Tidak tahukah kamu bahwa saualah Raja semua binatang?
Siapapun yang mengganggu istirahat saya layak mati! Saya akan membunuhmu dan
makanmu!'<br /><br />
Tikus tersebut ketakutan dan gemetaran, memohon agar sang
singa untuk membiarkannya pergi. 'Tolong jangan makan saya Yang Mulia! Saya
tidak bermaksud untuk membangunkan Anda, itu adalah sebuah kesalahan. Saya
hanya bermain. Tolong biarkan saya pergi - dan saya berjanji akan menjadi teman
Anda selamanya. Siapa tahu suatu hari saya bisa menyelamatkan hidup Anda?'<br /><br />
Singa menatap tikus kecil tersebut dan tertawa. "Kau
menyelamatkan hidup saya? Apa ide tidak masuk akal!" katanya mencemooh.
"Tapi kamu telah membuat saya tertawa, dan menempatkan saya ke dalam
suasana hati yang baik lagi, jadi saya akan membiarkan kamu pergi." Dan
singa membuka cakarnya dan membiarkan tikus itu pergi bebas.<br /><br />
"Oh terima kasih, Yang Mulia, 'decit tikus tersebut, dan
bergegas pergi secepat yang dia bisa.<br /><br />
Beberapa hari kemudian singa itu tertangkap dalam jerat
pemburu. Ia berjuang sebisa mungkin, ia tidak mampu melepaskan diri dan bahkan
menjadi lebih terjerat dalam jaring tali terseubt. Dia mengeluarkan raungan
kemarahan yang mengguncang hutan. Setiap hewan mendengarnya, termasuk tikus
kecil tersebut.<br /><br />Tikus itu pun bergegas menuju ke sumber aungan tersebut dan
ia mendapati sang singa sudah tidak berdaya. Tikus tersebut kemudian menggigit
tali yang menjerat singa sampai putus sehingga sang singa bisa lepas dari jerat
perangkap tersebut. Sang singa sangat berterima kasih pada tikus tersebut, dan
merekapun menjadi teman sejati selamanya.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>smoga membantu..tandai sbg jawaban terbaik ya</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>A Town Mouse and A Country Mouse
</p><p>
</p><p>
A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.
</p><p>
The flavour was not much to the taste of the guest and presently he broke out with “My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me and I promise you shall live on the fat of the land."
</p><p>
So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.
</p><p>
The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided. But before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again. But some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. "Good bye," said he, "I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."
</p><p>
Moral : Safety is the first importance.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Tikus Kota dan Tikus Desa</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tikus Kota dan Tikus Desa berteman. Tikus Desa suatu hari mengundang temannya untuk datang dan melihatnya di rumahnya di ladang. Tikus Kota datang dan mereka duduk untuk makan malam dengan barleycorn dan akar yang memiliki rasa yang sangat bersahaja.</p><p></p><p>Rasanya tidak terlalu sesuai dengan selera tamu dan saat ini dia berkata, “Sahabatku yang malang, kamu tinggal di sini tidak lebih baik dari semut. Sekarang, Anda hanya harus melihat bagaimana saya tarif! Lemari makan saya adalah tanduk biasa yang berlimpah. Kamu harus datang dan tinggal bersamaku dan aku berjanji kamu akan hidup di atas tanah yang lembek."</p><p></p><p>Jadi ketika dia kembali ke kota, dia membawa Tikus Pedesaan bersamanya dan menunjukkan padanya ke dalam lemari yang berisi tepung dan oatmeal, buah ara, madu, dan kurma.</p><p></p><p>Tikus Pedesaan belum pernah melihat yang seperti itu dan duduk untuk menikmati kemewahan yang disediakan temannya. Tapi sebelum mereka mulai dengan baik, pintu lemari makanan terbuka dan seseorang masuk. Kedua Tikus itu lari dan bersembunyi di lubang sempit dan sangat tidak nyaman. Saat ini, ketika semuanya tenang, mereka memberanikan diri keluar lagi. Tapi ada orang lain yang masuk, dan mereka kabur lagi. Ini terlalu banyak untuk pengunjung. "Selamat tinggal," katanya, "aku pergi. Kamu hidup di pangkuan kemewahan, aku bisa melihat, tetapi kamu dikelilingi oleh bahaya sedangkan di rumah aku bisa menikmati makan malam sederhana dari akar dan jagung dengan tenang."</p><p></p><p>Moral : Keselamatan adalah yang utama.</p><br />

Both of those conditions should be finished before sunrise.<br /><br />At night, Sangkuriang asked for help to spirit creatures to complete all the work. Dayang Sumbi secretly peeked at the job.

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

An important part of narrative text is the narrative mode, the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Legend of Banyuwangi<br /><br /><br />Once upon a time, in eastern part of Java Island, there was a kingdom ruled by a king. The king’s name was Prabu Menak Prakoso. One day, Prabu Menak and his soldiers invaded the kingdom of Klungkung in Bali. The king of Klungkung was killed, yet his daughter, Made Surati, and his son, Agung Bagus Mantra, were able to escape and hide in the jungle.<br /><br />Prabu Menak Prakoso had a son named Raden Banterang. He was such a handsome young man. One day, Raden Banterang went to the jungle for hunting. It was in the jungle that Raden Banterang met Made Surati. She was then taken to Blambangan to be his wife. Raden Banterang and Made Surati enjoyed a happy life in the Palace.<br /><br />When Raden Banterang was hunting one day, Made Surati was surprised by the arrival of a dirty beggar asking for her pity. The princess was surprised to find that the beggar was her older brother, Agung Bagus Mantra. She promptly squatted and embraced her brother’s legs. However, her great respect of her brother was not well accepted. Instead, Agung Bagus Mantra asked his sister to kill Raden Banterang. But such a request was rejected. He was very angry with her and came up with a sly idea to slander her.<br /><br />Slowly but surely, Agung succeeded in convincing Raden Banterang that his wife had been involved in a scandal with another man. Asking for compassion, Made Surati tried to tell the truth and denied her husband’s accusation. Hearing his wife explanation, the king became angrier and angrier. As a proof of her sacred love, she asked her husband to kill her. As her last request, she asked her husband to throw her dead body into the river. She said that if the water in the river smelled terrible, it meant that she had ever been sinful. But if it smelled fragrant, it meant that she was innocent.<br /><br />Raden Banterang who was unable to control his emotions soon stabbed his kerís (dagger) into his wife’s chest. She died instantly. The dead body of Made Surati was quickly thrown into the dirty river. Raden Banterang was shocked to see the river suddenly become clean and as clear as glass with a fragrant smell. Raden Banteraflll screamed crazily and regretted his deed. He walked unsteadìly and fell into the river screaming, “Banyu… Wangì… Banyuwangi!”  This means “fragrant water”.Banyuwangi was born from the proof of noble and sacred love. From then on, the place is called Banyuwangi.<br /><br /><br /><br />Below are the questions based on the story above using 5W1H<br /><br /><br />- What kingdoms were attacked by Prabumenakandhis army?<br /><br />- Who is the beggar who met with Made Surati ?<br /><br />- Where is the place Made Surati and Agung Bagus Mantra hide ?<br /><br />- Why did Made Suranti and Agung Bagus hide?<br /><br />- How is the place called Banyuwangi?<br /><br /><br /><br />Kelas : SMP<br /><br />Mapel : Bahasa Inggris<br /><br />Kategori : <br /><br />Kata kunci : Narrative Text, 5W1H<br /><br /><br /><br />

They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

                        “story of romance” is the guiding text offered by contemporary American culture, and more generally the culture of the modern West, on the subject of how women and men (should) relate: find your One True Love—your one-and-only—and live happily ever after.[1] To the ancient and perennial question of how to define and live the good life, how to achieve happiness and fulfillment, American pop culture’s resounding answer is through the narrative of romance, sex, and love. The happily-in-love, pair-bonded (generally, although increasingly not exclusively, heterosexual) couple is made into a near-mandatory norm by the media and popular culture, as this romance story is endlessly taught and replayed in a multiplicity of cultural sites: Disney princess movies consumed by three-year-olds, the wedding industry, Hollywood, pop music lyrics, advertising, popular magazines, the diamond jewelry industry, and more. One of the most important of these sites, where romance is taught, re-told, and—a crucial point—experimented with in new forms, is in the literal “romance story” of mass market genre fiction.While there are clearly significant differences—among these media forms and certainly among the diversity of the immense romance readership, as well as in the variety of subgenres and plots within the romance publishing field—nonetheless there are significant similarities across these categories as well. The basic plotline of the romance narrative holds true despite subgenre variation, which, as we’ll see in the case of erotica and paranormal, can serve simply to highlight the core genre message. As such, likening readers and novels and considering the phenomenon of romance narrative as a whole allows important insights to emerge. More specifically, in this article, I argue romance novels are so popular partly because they do deep and complicated work for the (mostly) women who read them—work that derives from the mythic or religious nature of the romance narrative that serves to engage readers in a “reparation fantasy” of healing in regards to male-female relations. Romance novels help women readers, especially heterosexual women, deal with their essentially paradoxical relationship toward men within a culture still marked by patriarchy and its component threat of violence toward women.[2]Most baldly put, this paradox has women in a position of simultaneously desiring and fearing men. Romance novels function as an antidote, as a way of pleasurably working through—in fantasy, in the safe and imaginative play world of fiction—the contradictory position of the heterosexual woman within patriarchal rape culture. This complex work, we will see, involves reconciling women to the limits and threats specifically posed to them as women by the culture, yet also teaching women to refuse to accept such limits and threats as normative and empowering them to expect or demand better for themselves. Furthermore, I argue that the industry subcategories of erotica (including gay/lesbian and “slash” romance) and paranormal—both areas of strong recent growth within the overall genre—offer new and highly effective literary means for women to use romance fiction as a way of working out their position within the culture. Indeed, the mainstream growth of erotica in particular signals important changes in American cultural attitudes towards women’s sexuality and perhaps, finally, a loosening of the patriarchal knot of allowable sexual expression.This article forms the initial part of an ongoing monograph project on the romance narrative in popular culture, focusing especially on popular romance fiction. I seek to understand how this romance narrative functions and how it is currently changing, both as a genre of popular literature and as a form of human relationship. Unlike some lines of previous academic inquiry into romance fiction, my goal has little to do with either critique or defense of the genre, nor do I aim for close literary reading of individual authors (e.g., Radway 1991, Coddington 1997, Regis 2003, Goade 2007). Like Tania Modleski, I seek to read “symptomatically” (2008, xix), not intending by this metaphor for romance fiction to be taken as illness or pathology, but simply as a rich cultural site that yields much insight into critical issues of gender and sexuality in America today. I seek to place romance fiction in the broader context of the romance narrative in popular culture; and to adopt a framework of cultural studies, religious studies, gender studies, and sex-positive feminist theory to ask questions about meaning, fantasy, fear, and desire in how the romance narrative plays out in the realms of both popular and high culture in which this story holds such vast sway.<br /><br />

                        CINDERELLA<br /><br /> One day, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with a wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a party and left Cinderella alone at home.<br /><br /> She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, because this magic will works only until midnight!”<br /><br /> When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.<br /><br /> Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.<br /><br /> In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into this glass slipper!”.<br /><br /> In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married Cinderella and they lived happily.<br />

All animals started to obey this order. <br /><br />It was the hare's day. The hare was very sad. As he was going to the lion's den, he came across an old well. He looked into it. It was very deep and dangerous. He made a plan to his mind. <br /><br />The lion was very angry that no animal had come that day. The hare slowly came towards the lion. The lion roared "Why are you late?" The hare humbly replied, "Oh my way another lion chased me. I got away with much difficulty to give my life to you, Your Majesty". <br /><br />The lion was pleased with the hare. But the thought of another lion in the jungle made him angry. The lion roared "Do you know where he lives?" The hare replied "Yes, Sir. Please come with me". <br /><br />The hare took the lion to the old well. He said "Sir, that lion lives in this well". The lion peeped into the well. He mistook his reflection for another lion. He roared and there was an echo. He thought that the other lion was roaring too and jumped into the well. That was the end of the lion. <br /><br />MORAL : Wisdom can win might.<br />
