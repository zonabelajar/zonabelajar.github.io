                        True Friends<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.<br /><br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.<br /><br />The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."<br />

Immigration. The officials are very kind. They checked our documents 
carefully and serve us with a very polite and friendly. my family and I

                        “story of romance” is the guiding text offered by contemporary American culture, and more generally the culture of the modern West, on the subject of how women and men (should) relate: find your One True Love—your one-and-only—and live happily ever after.[1] To the ancient and perennial question of how to define and live the good life, how to achieve happiness and fulfillment, American pop culture’s resounding answer is through the narrative of romance, sex, and love. The happily-in-love, pair-bonded (generally, although increasingly not exclusively, heterosexual) couple is made into a near-mandatory norm by the media and popular culture, as this romance story is endlessly taught and replayed in a multiplicity of cultural sites: Disney princess movies consumed by three-year-olds, the wedding industry, Hollywood, pop music lyrics, advertising, popular magazines, the diamond jewelry industry, and more. One of the most important of these sites, where romance is taught, re-told, and—a crucial point—experimented with in new forms, is in the literal “romance story” of mass market genre fiction.While there are clearly significant differences—among these media forms and certainly among the diversity of the immense romance readership, as well as in the variety of subgenres and plots within the romance publishing field—nonetheless there are significant similarities across these categories as well. The basic plotline of the romance narrative holds true despite subgenre variation, which, as we’ll see in the case of erotica and paranormal, can serve simply to highlight the core genre message. As such, likening readers and novels and considering the phenomenon of romance narrative as a whole allows important insights to emerge. More specifically, in this article, I argue romance novels are so popular partly because they do deep and complicated work for the (mostly) women who read them—work that derives from the mythic or religious nature of the romance narrative that serves to engage readers in a “reparation fantasy” of healing in regards to male-female relations. Romance novels help women readers, especially heterosexual women, deal with their essentially paradoxical relationship toward men within a culture still marked by patriarchy and its component threat of violence toward women.[2]Most baldly put, this paradox has women in a position of simultaneously desiring and fearing men. Romance novels function as an antidote, as a way of pleasurably working through—in fantasy, in the safe and imaginative play world of fiction—the contradictory position of the heterosexual woman within patriarchal rape culture. This complex work, we will see, involves reconciling women to the limits and threats specifically posed to them as women by the culture, yet also teaching women to refuse to accept such limits and threats as normative and empowering them to expect or demand better for themselves. Furthermore, I argue that the industry subcategories of erotica (including gay/lesbian and “slash” romance) and paranormal—both areas of strong recent growth within the overall genre—offer new and highly effective literary means for women to use romance fiction as a way of working out their position within the culture. Indeed, the mainstream growth of erotica in particular signals important changes in American cultural attitudes towards women’s sexuality and perhaps, finally, a loosening of the patriarchal knot of allowable sexual expression.This article forms the initial part of an ongoing monograph project on the romance narrative in popular culture, focusing especially on popular romance fiction. I seek to understand how this romance narrative functions and how it is currently changing, both as a genre of popular literature and as a form of human relationship. Unlike some lines of previous academic inquiry into romance fiction, my goal has little to do with either critique or defense of the genre, nor do I aim for close literary reading of individual authors (e.g., Radway 1991, Coddington 1997, Regis 2003, Goade 2007). Like Tania Modleski, I seek to read “symptomatically” (2008, xix), not intending by this metaphor for romance fiction to be taken as illness or pathology, but simply as a rich cultural site that yields much insight into critical issues of gender and sexuality in America today. I seek to place romance fiction in the broader context of the romance narrative in popular culture; and to adopt a framework of cultural studies, religious studies, gender studies, and sex-positive feminist theory to ask questions about meaning, fantasy, fear, and desire in how the romance narrative plays out in the realms of both popular and high culture in which this story holds such vast sway.<br /><br />

                        <p>                                                A Mouse and A Lion</p><p>Once, as a lion lay
sleeping in his den, a naughty little mouse ran up his tail, onto his back, up
his mane and danced and jumped on his head, so that the lion woke up.<br /><br />
lion angry grabbed the mouse and, holding him in
his large claws, roared in anger. 'How dare you wake me up! Don't you know that
I am King of the Beasts? Anyone who disturbs my rest deserves to die! I shall
kill you and eat you!'<br /><br />
The terrified mouse, shaking and trembling, begged
the lion to let him go. 'Please don't eat me Your Majesty! I did not mean to
wake you, it was a mistake. I was only playing. Please let me go - and I
promise I will be your friend forever. Who knows but one day I could save your
life?'<br /><br />
The lion looked at the tiny mouse and laughed.
'You save my life? What an absurd idea!' he said scornfully. 'But you have made
me laugh, and put me into a good mood again, so I shall let you go.' And the
lion opened his claws and let the mouse go free.<br /><br />
'Oh thank you, your majesty,' squeaked the mouse,
and scurried away as fast as he could.<br /><br />
A few days later the lion was caught in a hunter's
snare. Struggle as he might, he couldn't break free and became even more
entangled in the net of ropes. He let out a roar of anger that shook the
forest. Every animal heard it, including the tiny mouse.<br /><br />
The mouse was rushing to the source of its roar
and he found the lion was powerless. The mouse then bit the rope that cought
the lion so that the lion can escape from the trap. The lions are very grateful
to the mouse, and they became friends best forever.</p><p>                                 Seekor Tikus dan Seekor Singa<br /></p><p>Suatu ketika ada seekor singa yang sedang berbaring
tidur di sarangnya, tikus kecil nakal berlari ke ekornya, ke punggunya, ke
surainya dan menari serta melompat di kepalanya, sehingga singa itu pun
terbangun.<br /><br />
singa marah menerkam tikus tersebut dan memegangnya dalam
kuku-kukunya yang besar, meraung dalam kemarahan. "Berani-beraninya kau
membangunkan saya! Tidak tahukah kamu bahwa saualah Raja semua binatang?
Siapapun yang mengganggu istirahat saya layak mati! Saya akan membunuhmu dan
makanmu!'<br /><br />
Tikus tersebut ketakutan dan gemetaran, memohon agar sang
singa untuk membiarkannya pergi. 'Tolong jangan makan saya Yang Mulia! Saya
tidak bermaksud untuk membangunkan Anda, itu adalah sebuah kesalahan. Saya
hanya bermain. Tolong biarkan saya pergi - dan saya berjanji akan menjadi teman
Anda selamanya. Siapa tahu suatu hari saya bisa menyelamatkan hidup Anda?'<br /><br />
Singa menatap tikus kecil tersebut dan tertawa. "Kau
menyelamatkan hidup saya? Apa ide tidak masuk akal!" katanya mencemooh.
"Tapi kamu telah membuat saya tertawa, dan menempatkan saya ke dalam
suasana hati yang baik lagi, jadi saya akan membiarkan kamu pergi." Dan
singa membuka cakarnya dan membiarkan tikus itu pergi bebas.<br /><br />
"Oh terima kasih, Yang Mulia, 'decit tikus tersebut, dan
bergegas pergi secepat yang dia bisa.<br /><br />
Beberapa hari kemudian singa itu tertangkap dalam jerat
pemburu. Ia berjuang sebisa mungkin, ia tidak mampu melepaskan diri dan bahkan
menjadi lebih terjerat dalam jaring tali terseubt. Dia mengeluarkan raungan
kemarahan yang mengguncang hutan. Setiap hewan mendengarnya, termasuk tikus
kecil tersebut.<br /><br />Tikus itu pun bergegas menuju ke sumber aungan tersebut dan
ia mendapati sang singa sudah tidak berdaya. Tikus tersebut kemudian menggigit
tali yang menjerat singa sampai putus sehingga sang singa bisa lepas dari jerat
perangkap tersebut. Sang singa sangat berterima kasih pada tikus tersebut, dan
merekapun menjadi teman sejati selamanya.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>smoga membantu..tandai sbg jawaban terbaik ya</p><br />

He was such a handsome young man. One day, Raden Banterang went to the jungle for hunting. It was in the jungle that Raden Banterang met Made Surati. She was then taken to Blambangan to be his wife. Raden Banterang and Made Surati enjoyed a happy life in the Palace.<br /><br />When Raden Banterang was hunting one day, Made Surati was surprised by the arrival of a dirty beggar asking for her pity. The princess was surprised to find that the beggar was her older brother, Agung Bagus Mantra. She promptly squatted and embraced her brother’s legs. However, her great respect of her brother was not well accepted. Instead, Agung Bagus Mantra asked his sister to kill Raden Banterang. But such a request was rejected. He was very angry with her and came up with a sly idea to slander her.<br /><br />Slowly but surely, Agung succeeded in convincing Raden Banterang that his wife had been involved in a scandal with another man. Asking for compassion, Made Surati tried to tell the truth and denied her husband’s accusation. Hearing his wife explanation, the king became angrier and angrier. As a proof of her sacred love, she asked her husband to kill her. As her last request, she asked her husband to throw her dead body into the river. She said that if the water in the river smelled terrible, it meant that she had ever been sinful. But if it smelled fragrant, it meant that she was innocent.<br /><br />Raden Banterang who was unable to control his emotions soon stabbed his kerís (dagger) into his wife’s chest. She died instantly. The dead body of Made Surati was quickly thrown into the dirty river. Raden Banterang was shocked to see the river suddenly become clean and as clear as glass with a fragrant smell. Raden Banteraflll screamed crazily and regretted his deed. He walked unsteadìly and fell into the river screaming, “Banyu… Wangì… Banyuwangi!”  This means “fragrant water”.Banyuwangi was born from the proof of noble and sacred love. From then on, the place is called Banyuwangi.<br /><br /><br /><br />Below are the questions based on the story above using 5W1H<br /><br /><br />- What kingdoms were attacked by Prabumenakandhis army?<br /><br />- Who is the beggar who met with Made Surati ?<br /><br />- Where is the place Made Surati and Agung Bagus Mantra hide ?<br /><br />- Why did Made Suranti and Agung Bagus hide?<br /><br />- How is the place called Banyuwangi?<br /><br /><br /><br />Kelas : SMP<br /><br />Mapel : Bahasa Inggris<br /><br />Kategori : <br /><br />Kata kunci : Narrative Text, 5W1H<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        The Ant And The Grasshopper<br />In a field one summer’s day a grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content. An ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.<br />“Why not come and chat with me,” said the grasshopper, “instead of toiling and moiling in that way?”<br />“I am helping to lay up food for the winter,” said the ant, “and recommend you to do the same.”<br />“Why bother about winter?” said the grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present.” The Ant went on its way and continued its toil.<br />When the winter came the grasshopper found itself dying of hunger while it saw the ants distributing, every day, corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer.<br /><br />Di suatu lapangan, saat musim panas, seekor  belalang melompat girang, berkicau dan bernyanyi sesuka hatinya. Sementara seekeor semut sedang lewat, sambil mambawa bongkahan biji jagung dibawahnya dengan susah payah menuju sarangnya.<br />"Mengapa kamu tidak disini saja sambil ngobrol denganku," kata Belalang, "dari pada lalulalang kerja keras seperti itu??"<br />"Aku bekerja  untuk mengumpulkan makanan sebegai persediaan musim dingin nanti," kata semut itu, "dan memeberikan contoh padamu supaya kamu juga mengumpulkan makanan seperti aku."<br />"Kenapa aku harus repot-repot mengkhawatirkan musim dingin" kata Belalang; "Kami sudah punya banyak makanan saat ini." Meskipun begitu semut itu tetap melanjutkan dan terus kerja keras.<br />Ketika musim dingin datang, belalang itu pun mati kelaparan, sementara si semut mendistribusikan jagung dan gandum setiap hari dari toko mereka yang sudah dikumpulkan saat musim panas yang lalu.<br /><br />

 wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very
 bad and did not appreciate her. Near from her home, there was a king’s 
palace which was so beautiful and there would be held a big party. Her 
stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, 
they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the 
party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she 
did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a
 party and left Cinderella alone at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy 
godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball 
now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a
 dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be 
worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into 
the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy 
godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly 
Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and 
said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother
 then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden
 four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy 
Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, 
because this magic will works only until midnight!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her 
beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so 
different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass 
slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He 
met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I 
want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night 
and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother 
warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last 
moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and 
went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass 
slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the 
clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous 
shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress 
anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked 
about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very 
curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in 
love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even 
did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he 
said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into 
this glass slipper!”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the 
existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the 
size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper 
but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her 
stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let 
her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect 
leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced 
that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married 
Cinderella and they lived happily.</p><br /><br /><br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

                        <p> </p><p>Legend of Bledug kuwu</p><p></p><p>In a long time ago, around 7th BC, Grobogan was included in Medang Kamulan Kingdom ruled by Sanjaya Dynasty. One of the kings of this dynasty was Dewata Cengkar, a reputedly very fond of eating human flesh. Because the king’s favorite was strange, the people felt fear. They did not want to be one of the king’s preys. Nothing could beat the king with his power.</p><p></p><p>One day, there were Ajisaka, a nomad, who were concerned with the suffering experienced by the people. Then, Ajisaka was trying to stop the practice of the king. Witnessed by thousands of pairs of eyes, Ajisaka also challenged the king to compete their magic power. Many people doubted the ability of Ajisaka, considering his small body. But several communities still put their hopes to Ajisaka. The king accepted the challenge of Ajisaka only with laughter. The King also offered, if ever Ajisaka was able to defeat him, then Ajisaka was entitled to a prize of half the kingdom. Conversely, the King would take Ajisaka’s body.</p><p></p><p>Ajisaka accepted the King’s offer. One last demand of Ajisaka, if he was defeated and his body is eaten by the King, was to bury his bones in the ground which was as wide as his headgear. The King absolutely agreed it and didn’t infer at all whether Ajisaka’s headgear was a sacred headgear. Ajisaka took his headgear off soon and put it on the ground. Suddenly, the headgear became very wide so that King Dewata Cengkar must stepped backward. Because of the width of Ajisaka’s headgear, King Dewata Cengkar was thrown in the South Sea. The King, however, did not die and turned into "bajul" (white crocodile). Afterwards, the people crowned Ajisaka as the King of Medang Kamulan.</p><p></p><p>When Ajisaka ruled Medang Kamulan, there was a dragon whose name was Jaka Linglung. According to his confession, he was Ajisaka’s son and he was searching for his father. Regarding his shape, Ajisaka refused to confess him as his son. Ajisaka tried to expel the dragon euphemistically. Ajisaka promised the dragon that he would confess him as his son if he could kill the white crocodile who was Dewata Cengkar in the South Sea. Because of it, Jaka Linglung afforded Ajisaka’s demand to kill Dewata Cengkar. Jaka Linglung left Medang Kamulan. Ajisaka forbade Jaka Linglung through the land so that he didn’t bother the people’s tranquillity. Conversely, Ajisaka required Jaka Linglung to go to the South Sea through the underground.</p><p></p><p>In brief, Jaka Linglung arrived in the South Sea and killed Dewata Cengkar. As the way he departed, he went back to Medang Kamulan through the underground. As the proof that he had arrived in the South Sea and killed Dewata Cengkar, Jaka Linglung brought a bundle of grinting wulung grass and the salty sea water.</p><p></p><p>Jaka Linglung tried to appear to the surface several times because of the suspect that he had been in his destinations. The first time he appeared was in the Village Ngembak (now the City Purwodadi District), in Jono (Tawangharjo District), in Grabagan, Crewek, and the last was in Kuwu (third entry Kradenan District). In Kuwu, Jaka Linglung was releasing his tiredness. The tracks of his emergence created some mud explosions. And this is, where the emergence was appeared, now believed to be the original legend of Bledhug Kuwu.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

I will set it up. You can help me and other dogs guard the sheep. In that way, we will not have to worry about theft of sheep again and you do not have to worry about going hungry again. It's a good deal for both of us. "<br />The wolf thought about it for a few minutes and then decided that the dog was right. So they went together to the farm house where the dog lived. But, while on the journey, the wolf saw that the hair in a certain part of the dog's neck is very thin. He was curious about it, for dogs that have such a beautiful coat every body. Finally, he asked the dog about it.<br />"Oh, do not worry about it," said the dog.

If I come to stay with you, I will also be chained at night?"<br />That's right, "said the dog." But, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. I do not think about it anymore. "<br />"But, if I was chained, then I will not be able to walk when I want to go for a walk or to run where I want to run," said the wolf. "If I come to stay with you, I will not be free again." Having said that, the wolf turned around and ran.<br />
