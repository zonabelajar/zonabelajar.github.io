                        Zayn Malik is best known as one of the founding members of the 
chart-topping boy-band-of-a-generation One Direction. Born Zain Javadd 
Malik on January 12, 1993 in the working-class town of Bradford in West 
Yorkshire, England, Zayn honed his vocal talents and stage command at a 
young age. Growing up as a mixed race Pakistani-English Muslim in a 
post-industrial British town presented some difficulties, which resulted
 in a number of primary school changes. His talents were eventually 
fostered at Tong High School, where he delved into performing arts and 
stage production, even starring as Danny Zuko in the school's production
 of Grease. In 2010, he auditioned for The X Factor but was eliminated 
(along with his future One Direction bandmates, who also auditioned 
solo). The quintet was later brought back as a group and Simon Cowell 
dubbed them One Direction. Despite finishing in third place, their 
popularity exploded and would not slow their trajectory until the very 
end. After the show, Cowell immediately signed them to his label, Syco 
Records, kicking off a craze that hadn't been seen since the turn of the
 millennium with the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. From 2011 to 2014, One 
Direction released an album each year, each one more successful than the
 last. Their fourth album, Four, would turn out to be the last with 
Zayn. In March 2015, while the band was on the On the Road Again Tour, 
Malik abruptly parted ways with One Direction a week after his final 
appearance with the group in Hong Kong. Citing stress and a desire for a
 simpler life out of the spotlight, Malik later revealed that he simply 
wanted to make music that he would listen to and enjoy. Striking out on 
his own, he signed with RCA Records and moved to Los Angeles, where he 
began working on his solo effort with James "Malay" Ho (Frank Ocean, Big
 Boi). His debut single, "Pillowtalk," was released in late January 2016
 under the name ZAYN and featured his strong vocals over distinctly more
 adult-themed alt-R&amp;B similar to The Weeknd and Miguel. The single 
debuted and #1 on the Billboard charts. His full-length debut, Mind of 
Mine, was released on March 25, 2016, one year to the day after he left 
One Direction. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi    <br /><br />Selena Marie Gomez was born and raised in Grand Prairie, Texas, to Mandy Teefey,
 who is of part Italian descent, and Ricardo Gomez, who is of Mexican 
descent and originally from New Mexico. Her parents divorced in 1997. 
Giving birth to Selena at 16, her mom Mandy recalls living 
"paycheck-to-paycheck". Selena started out on Barney &amp; Friends
 (1992) as "Gianna" in 2001 where she really discovered her talent. 
Unfortunately, they dropped her from the series after just two years. In
 2003, she had a very small role in the movie Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and a bit part in 2005 when she played "Julie" in Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005) with Mitchel Musso and in 2006 as "Emily Grace Garcia" in Brain Zapped (2006) when she recorded a song for the movie. She she guest starred as "Gwen" in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody (2005) and as Hannah's rival, the 'evil' "Mikayla", in Hannah Montana
 (2006). Selena's amazing talent landed her roles in two Disney series, 
both spin-offs. Unfortunately, neither show was picked up until 2007 
when she got the role of "Alex Russo" in the magical series Wizards of Waverly Place (2007) which she auditioned for three times. In March 2008, she made her first animated movie Horton Hears a Who! (2008) and later starred in Another Cinderella Story (2008) with Disney Channel star Drew Seeley for ABC Family. Her two Disney Channel Original Movies Princess Protection Program (2009), with real-life BFF Demi Lovato, and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie (2009) will both air Summer 2009.<br /><br /><br />

Although it is so contrary to traditional culture prevailing at the time.<br /><br />For opposing the Government of the Netherlands East Indies, her mother was exiled to Ternate, while her father died. So, Dewi Sartika brought up by her maternal uncle, a brother of her mom, who called Arya. At that time, Arya was a governor in Cicalengka.<br /><br />Dewi Sartika gained the knowledge about the Sundanese culture of her uncle. She was also knowledgeable of Western culture that she got from a lady of Dutch Resident Assistant.<br /><br />She showed her potential in the world of education as a child. In fact, she taught children of kepatihan maid, so they were all able to read and write a few words in Dutch.<br /><br />This made Cicalengka in an uproar.

                        When she was 12 years old, she had to quit studying because she had to do “pingit” at that time, a rule of Javanese custom that forbid woman to go outside before marriage. Finally, on 12th November 1983 she was married to Raden Adipati Joyodiningrat.<br /><br />After getting married, R.A Kartini never stopped learning. She continued to study in her own house by reading a lot of European books and magazines. When she was reading them, she found a great difference between European women’s life with Indonesian women. European women live in freedom and they have the same equivalent position with men. While, Indonesia women lived under man’s power.<br /><br />Based on that fact, she had an idea to change Indonesian women’s life. She along with her friends opened the first school for women in Indonesiain 1912 in Semarang. They taught Indonesian women how to read and write, so that they could come out of ignorance.<br /><br />In addition to teaching, she also wrote letters to her friends in the Netherlands. One of them is Rosa Abendanon which strongly supported Kartini’s idea. She also often wrote to the Dutch women’s magazine De Hollandsche Lelieseveral times.<br /><br />Thanks to her efforts, many women schools were built in other areas such as in Surabaya, Yogyakarta, Malang, Madiun, and Cirebon. Moreover, there was also Kartini Foundation, founded by Van Deventer’s family who is a political figures, opened Kartini’s School.<br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Agus Salim was born Masjhoedoelhaq Salim on October 8, 1884, in the village of Koto Gadang, a suburb of Fort de Kock. His father, Sutan Mohammad Salim, was a colonial prosecutor and judge whose highest rank was chief judge for the indigenous court in Tanjung Pinang. His birth name, which translates into "defender of truth", was changed into Agus Salim early in his childhood.</p><p></p><p>Salim received his elementary education at Europeesche Lagere School (ELS); at that time, it was considered a privilege for a non-European kid to attend an all-European school. He continued his studies at the Hogere Burgerschool (HBS) in Batavia, and graduated with highest score in the whole Dutch East Indies. Salim's father had applied (and was granted) for his two sons, Agus and Jacob, to be granted an equal status with the Europeans. However, his efforts to secure a government scholarship to study medicine in the Netherlands fell short. Kartini, another European-educated student whose writings on women's rights and emancipation became famous later, offered to defer her own scholarship for Salim; this, too, was rejected.</p><p></p><p>C.S. Hurgronje, a prominent colonial administrator best known for his study of native affairs, took Salim under his wing and arranged for him to left the Indies on 1905 to work as an interpreter and secretary at the Dutch consulate in Jeddah, where he handled hajj affairs; in some way, it was to distance him from the radical teachings of a close relative, the well-known Shafi'i imam of Masjid al-Haram Ahmad Khatib al-Minangkabawi.</p><p></p><p>Salim returned to the Indies in 1911 and pursued a career in journalism, contributing pieces for magazines and publications like Hindia Baroe, Fadjar Asia, and Moestika. He would later served as an editor in Neratja, a newspaper aligned with the Sarekat Islam, where he was also an active member. While in that, he founded a private Hollandsche Indische School (HIS) in his hometown of Koto Gadang, but left after three years to return to Java.</p><br />
